The biggest single fine, of CHF 28.5 million, was imposed on Citigroup, followed by Barclays (CHF 27m), RBS (CHF 22.5m), JP Morgan (CHF 9.5m) and Japan’s MUFG (CHF 1.5m).
The Swiss Competition Commission, aka Weko, found that traders at the five banks had worked together in a cartel-style arrangement to manipulate currency prices for their own gain.
Weko’s penalty came three weeks after the European Union (EU) fined the same five banks a total of €1.o7 billion after its own five-year investigation into manipulation of the $5trillion-a-day forex market.
In both cases UBS Group escaped a fine because it blew the whistle on the other banks’ misconduct, while Credit Suisse is reported to be contesting allegations that it also participated and has refused to settle.
The rigging of the rates involved traders exchanging information in online chat rooms between 2007 and 2013 in cartels they called the Three-Way Banana Split and Essex Express.
Since allegations of benchmark currency rate manipulation first surfaced in 2013 more than a dozen financial institutions have paid almost $12 billion in fines around the world.
UK banking watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) held its own investigation into the affair and handed out fines of £1.3 billion in 2014 over regulation breaches, whereas the EU and Swiss authorities were investigating the impact on competition"

What makes FNBO unique is its commitment to building trusted and transparent relationships with customers so that they can provide the best financial advice possible.
Delivering gpi data insights
FNBO is constantly looking for ways to help their clients to expand their international business – whether that be exporting agriculture commodities to China, exporting farm machinery to Australia, or offering financial services to firms in London. Yet, due to the frictions inherent in the traditional correspondent banking system, the bank has not always been able to offer its customers the smooth cross border payments service they desire. Until recently, neither FNBO nor its customers had the data they needed to track and trace international payments.
“We really couldn't tell if a payment got there or not,” Michael Salerno, vice president, Global Banking Group at First National Bank of Omaha told SWIFT. “For payment initiation it was fine, but if things went wrong, we had to rely on our correspondents, or the beneficiary bank, to resolve issues. It meant a lot of heartburn, plus time and effort on our end.”
The drive for data
“The data is crucial for us,” commented Salerno, “If we really want to be true partners to our clients, we need to continually find ways to make their lives easier and to help them save money.""
That’s where SWIFT gpi came into play, when the solution first went live with the bank back in 2017. 
“It was a huge moment for us,” Salerno noted. “We began to receive the data that we needed to provide certainty to customers. Since then, not only can we offer a better customer experience, but we can also deliver on transparency of fees.”
Guaranteed data access
Despite the improvements, the bank had to rely on their counterparts to provide the gpi data they needed. Soon the team realised they needed full control of the data in order to deliver the customer service they pride themselves on. 
“We noticed that in the early days of gpi, when our counterparties went live they provided us with all the data,"" explained Salerno. ""Then we started seeing it be sanitised somewhat and then some of the data disappeared"

""Then we started seeing it be sanitised somewhat and then some of the data disappeared. We felt that in order to keep our promise to our customers to be as transparent as we can, direct gpi membership was a crucial step for us.""
FNBO became full members of SWIFT gpi in 2020.
Offering a digital experience
Guaranteed access to the gpi tracker data opens up a number of opportunities for FNBO. To access the data, the bank previously had to rely on multiple different apps offered by their counterparties.
The bank can now pass the information directly on to their customers. Ultimately, the vision is to offer customers an API to fully integrate with the gpi tracker on the backend. This will allow them to check the status and details of their international transactions directly from their own treasury management applications.
“They can always give FNBO a call, but if they want quicker access to the data, they’ll have it at their fingertips,” Salerno said. “It’s all about giving clients the digital experience that they want - and that's what gpi is going to enable.”"

The core objectives of the initiative, known as Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative (CIISI-EU), are to protect the financial system by preventing, detecting and responding to cyberattacks; to facilitate the sharing of information and good practices between financial infrastructures; and to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats.
“This is the first time that major financial infrastructures, Europol and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) have jointly taken steps against cyber risk,” said ECB Executive Board member and ECRB chair, Fabio Panetta. “We hope this will be an inspiring model for other jurisdictions to tackle one of the biggest threats of our time. Cybercriminals are increasingly stealing money, and therefore sharing information will help us to prevent attacks and ultimately protect people’s money.”
In the coming months, the ECB will publish the framework for the CIISI-EU sharing initiative to encourage other jurisdictions to follow suit.
Cyber threats pose a serious risk to the stability of the European and global financial system. Cyber threats are borderless and the capabilities of the attackers are constantly evolving, threatening to disrupt the interconnected global financial systems. To successfully combat cyber risk, financial infrastructures need to actively participate in information and intelligence sharing arrangements and collaborate with trusted stakeholders within the industry as a whole.
“Cybercriminals have always been good at sharing their modus operandi, tactics and intelligence with each other and we could learn to mirror this behaviour across our ecosystem,” commented Brett Lancaster, head of the Customer Security Programme at SWIFT and chair of the ECRB intelligence sharing working group. “Research shows that the exchange of relevant and timely cyber threat intelligence has proved critical in effectively detecting and preventing attacks. This is why we set out to create a framework which we will implement that simplifies the process of intelligence sharing by re-using proven components, adding value through disseminating strategic information and allowing each member to implement it at their own pace. This, we hope, will make it easier for those involved to protect consumers as well as the financial industry from cybercriminals.”"

Converting cash is becoming harder: While revenues are up by 10% on last year, this year we’ve seen a decline in companies’ ability to turn higher revenue into casH
Capital expenditure is continuing to decline: Capital expenditure (capex) as a percentage of revenues has plummeted during the last five years, suggesting that companies are managing cash flows by cutting investment.

Yesterday’s Association of Corporate Treasurers’ Working Capital Conference 2018, sponsored by NatWest was well attended - over 150 attendees - and produced some key lessons, facts and figures about working capital management, but was inevitably taken up with repeated references to Brexit: 

Overall:
	
What gets measured, gets done:
		
in working capital management companies need to measure what is going on right now. Then and only then, can companies start to manage
companies don’t need expensive consultants to do this for them
once the full position is known then it can be managed


Cash is being stockpiled worldwide as companies continue to be cautious
Corporate treasurers think they own cash (but there was some doubt about this)
working capital programmes are messy with attention to boring details needed (and not glamorous like launching a $200 million bond) 


Supply chains 
	
Global review by David Henig, Director, UK Trade Policy, gave a gloomy view about Trump and China, etc.; his closing comment was “There will be not quite complete chaos.” 
Need to understand your whole supply chain, not just the parts that you deal with directly because you could be vulnerable to what happens with them. (NatWest were promoting their new service, which is coming next year, that will help companies map all the suppliers in their supply chain.)
Corporate cannot assume that the funding in their supply chain finance solution will continue, need to check
Using an independent supply chain platform with separate funding arrangements with banks, etc"

Corporate cannot assume that the funding in their supply chain finance solution will continue, need to check
Using an independent supply chain platform with separate funding arrangements with banks, etc., is safer than going with a bank platform


Working capital programmes
	
First need to convince senior management
Holistic approach is essential so the whole programme works together
Must also track unearned discounts as well as the invoice processing, etc.
Convincing the whole company is vital
Working capital programmes normally take 6-12 months to implement but in some cases (particularly if the company has multiple sites) 2-3 years
Regular reports on working capital programme progress, for all parts of the organisation, are essential
The programme needs to be ongoing so immediate improvements are not lost


Sources of supply chain finance:
	
There are many different types available and many different players, no agreement as to which supplier is better for which type of corporate 
Unappreciated suppliers include:
		
Elcom
Credit insurance suppliers. e.g. Marsh


Peer2Peer lending is not here yet


Cash flow forecasting is difficult and no-one has a complete answer, it requires, like all things in working capital management, continuous and boring attention to detail:
	
Make sure people supplying the data understand how and why it is used


Late payments debate (by large corporates):
	
Large corporates do not understand why setting extended payment terms and then paying on time still impacts the SME.

In the latest of its escalating programme of financial sanctions the United States has prevented the Russian government from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than US$600 million from reserves held at US banks
After Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, an initial package of sanctions included the freezing of foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at US financial institutions. However,  the Treasury Department had been allowing the Russian government to use the funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis.
On 4 April, as the largest of the payments came due, including a US$552.4 million principal payment on a maturing bond, the US government decided to cut off Moscow’s access to the frozen funds, a US Treasury spokesperson told Reuters. A US$84 million coupon payment was also due the same day on a 2042 sovereign dollar bond.
The move aims to force Moscow to make the difficult decision of whether it would use dollars that it has access to for payments on its debt or for other purposes, including supporting its war effort, the spokesperson said. Russia faces a historic default if it chooses to not do so.
“Beginning today, the US Treasury will not permit any dollar debt payments to be made from Russian government accounts at US financial institutions,” the spokesperson added. “Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default.”
A Bloomberg report notes that to date, a carve-out in US policies has allowed overseas and US investors so far to receive payments on Russian foreign-currency debt, even as restrictions complicate the process. The exemption is set to expire on 25 May.
“It seems to me that it is a U-turn of what the US government allowed on 17 March, when Russia paid a US$117 million coupon,” commented Carl Wong, head of fixed income at Avenue Asset Management Ltd. in Hong Kong, which owns no Russian dollar debt.

UK government plans cryptocurrency NFT
UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak has ordered the Royal Mint, producer of Britain’s coinage for over 1,000 years, to create its own non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as part of the government’s attempts to demonstrate that Britain is open to cryptocurrency businesses.
Sunak said that the Mint, which also sells commemorative coins to mark special events, would sell the tokens as an “emblem of the forward-looking approach the UK is determined to take”.
However, his announcement drew ridicule from several commentators: Simon French, an economist at Panmure Gordon, dismissed it as a late April Fool’s Day joke, independent economist Julian Jessop asked: “What on earth is the point of this?” and Mauricio Magaldi, of financial services consultancy 11:FS said: “The news that the Treasury will be launching NFTs later this year seems to be nothing more than a strategic PR play”.
The Mint’s own announcement described the move as a “natural progression” and added: “The Royal Mint is one of the world’s leading providers of premium collectables, making this a natural progression for us. By creating NFTs we plan to help customers own digital collectables in a secure and trusted way, while engaging a new audience with The Royal Mint"

Santander adds instant payments into Brazil from Europe
Santander Bank has launched an international payments service for Spain’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and corporate clients that enables them to make immediate international payments to recipients in Brazil, in Brazilian Real (BRL), through the One Trade solution.
The Spanish bank says it is the first in Europe to launch a custom-built payments solution that allows customers to make transfers into Brazil in local currencies and in real time. The new service is provided through Santander’s PagoNxt business unit and is designed to shorten the payment times between transfers from several days to just minutes, while also removing the need of FX documentation and third parties.
SMEs and corporate clients in Spain can also use the One Trade solution to make instant payments in BRL to recipients from Brazil through online banking. The service will be extended to customers in markets outside Spain over the months ahead.
Figures for 2021 show that around 5,000 Spanish SMEs processed payments to companies in Brazil, counting for over €4 billion spent; a 14% increase from 2020. Santander’s new solution aims to facilitate cross-border payments and integrate digital banks into the ecosystem, including the ones that don’t currently support international payments"

Figures for 2021 show that around 5,000 Spanish SMEs processed payments to companies in Brazil, counting for over €4 billion spent; a 14% increase from 2020. Santander’s new solution aims to facilitate cross-border payments and integrate digital banks into the ecosystem, including the ones that don’t currently support international payments.
Fernando Lardiés, general manager of PagoNxt Trade, and global head of One Trade, told Finextra that the current user experience for currency transfers to Brazil is an opaque and complex process, which often leaves customers waiting for several days for payment.
PagoNxt Trade aims to become a platform through which to provide services to Santander entities and clients via their normal online banking with single sign-on, and to extend these into regions where Santander is not present as a commercial bank. “Our ambition is to become the provider of the services for banks, but with significant service enhancements such as this one.”
 
Bolero and TradeLens partner on electronic bills of lading
Cloud-based trade finance digitisation group Bolero International has announced a collaboration with the blockchain-based global trade platform TradeLens to provide a digital service for importers and exporters using electronic bills of lading (eBLs) in trade finance transactions.
Bolero’s trade finance digitisation platform, Galileo, connects corporate clients with trade partners and banks and allows corporates to manage their Letters of Credit (LCs), guarantees, Standby LCs, ePresentations under LCs, open account and documentary bills for collection (DCs), and electronic bills of lading in a single solution.
TradeLens’ eBL platform for containerised goods providers simplifies the issuance, transfer, and surrender of original shipping document in structure format allowing for the digitisation and automation of supply chain and financial processes and is an eBL solution accepted by industries including ocean carriers, banks, and regulators. 
TradeLens eBL will be integrated into Bolero’s Galileo platform, connecting the two platforms’ respective networks of banks, corporates, and supply chain participants, to provide “a streamlined and seamless experience for users of Galileo who wish to leverage TradeLens eBL’s carrier network"
7416,3188,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/industry-roundup-fifth-april,Industry roundup: 5 April,2022-04-05,,"TradeLens eBL will be integrated into Bolero’s Galileo platform, connecting the two platforms’ respective networks of banks, corporates, and supply chain participants, to provide “a streamlined and seamless experience for users of Galileo who wish to leverage TradeLens eBL’s carrier network.”
The partners comment that the Covid-19 pandemic has emphasised the critical value and fragility of global supply chains, especially how relatively minor disruptions can have enormous knock-on impacts to interconnected global economies across raw materials, commodities and complex elaborately transformed manufactures (ETM) such as semiconductors.
This has underpinned demand for various digital solutions, including the use of eBLs which are a key shipping document facilitating the transfer goods titles. Corporates have been forced to use multiple solutions to address the complexity and diversity of the challenges in global trade, resulting in an inconsistent approach and disjointed customer experience. 

“Bolero has a vision to connect the physical and financial flows to digitise trade finance,” said Bolero CEO, Andrew Raymond. “For this to happen, we need to be able to provide a common view of the data and documentation that is shared between all parties in the supply-chain process. Our investments in the Galileo platform make this possible”

“Our strategy with TradeLens is to provide access to the TradeLens Electronic Bill of Lading from within the Bolero Galileo application. This will leverage the Bolero bank network to more easily connect corporates and banks involved in financing goods in transit. Our goal is to become an aggregator of various electronic documents in Trade to provide a single point of access to our clients and giving both banks and corporates the ability to easily access and exchange these documents as part of their Trade transaction flows.” 

TradeLens and GTD Solution CEO, Michael White added: “The approach of integrating solutions where customers need them is common in the digital realm, which means users of technology gain access to best-in-class services without additional or multiple integrations. This collaboration is a practical example of connectivity for global trade and platforms and enables local communities in emerging and developed markets to participate in financial and trade opportunities.”.

Australian Securities and Investments Commission sues Macquarie
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is suing Macquarie Bank for what it alleges are serious cash management account lapses.
ASIC claims that the bank failed to monitor and prevent A$2.9 million of withdrawals by convicted former financial adviser Ross Hopkins. Hemwas sentenced in May 2021 to a maximum period of six years for misappropriating about $2.9 million from his clients without their knowledge over a three-year period from October 2016.
In civil proceedings ASIC claims that Macquarie’s monitoring of the transactions was limited and while there was a ‘fee authority’ provision which allowed the adviser to deduct a fee, the transactions did not pass through the fraud monitoring system or undergo checks to ensure the transactions were for fees. The alleged lapses took place between 1 May 2016 and 15 January 2020.

ASIC’s deputy chairman, Sarah Court, said that although Hopkins had been “dealt with appropriately in the court”, the regulator had investigated how he was able to perpetuate the fraud. “When we had a look at Macquarie’s systems and compliance checks and what we say is there were significant failures to detect and prevent these frauds from occurring,” she commented.
Macquarie should have detected a “range of red flags” and although the bank was on notice that Mr Hopkins was a potentially problematic individual, it took no action to prevent the frauds from occurring. The regulator also alleges that Macquarie made false or misleading representations in promoting its cash management accounts as having features that limit third-party access, in particular where fee authority had been granted.

Macquarie had said it would check that any transaction made under the ‘fee authority’ was actually for fees, but did not do so, ASIC said.

In a statement, Macquarie responded that it had co-operated with the matter and that the 13 clients that suffered losses had been fully reimbursed. “Macquarie treats the security of its clients’ accounts with the utmost seriousness and has continued to introduce new controls and processes to respond to the evolving external fraud environment,” the bank said"

Citi adds sustainable trade and working capital loans solution
Citi has announced the launch of its Sustainable Trade and Working Capital Loans (Sustainable T&WC Loans) solution in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM) and Asia Pacific (APAC) regions.
The launch follows the rollout of Citi’s Sustainable Supply Chain Finance offering as “the next step of the journey to expand Citi’s sustainable Trade and Working Capital Solutions as a key part of Citi’s broader commitment to advancing its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) agenda.”
Citi said that T&WC Loans assist clients in managing their working capital needs, by financing their international trade finance activities and general day-to-day commercial activities, helping to improve liquidity. The Sustainable T&WC Loans solution can also support clients with their sustainability goals, where the proceeds of the loan are used for an environmental or social purpose. Should certain sustainability criteria be met, the solution can provide clients a framework for incentivised pricing.
Peadar Mac Canna, Head of EMEA Trade and Working Capital business at Citi said the bank is closely working with our clients to support their supply chains and ecosystem transition to a sustainable, low-carbon business model that balances the environmental, social and economic needs of society.
“Companies around the world are increasingly looking at how to incorporate sustainable practices across their businesses,” said Davida Heller, Head of Sustainability Strategy, Citi. “We are supporting our clients at every step of their journey with our products and services, and this extended working capital loan offering represents yet another tool in our toolbox to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals.”
Citi added that the Sustainable T&WC Loans product will initially launch in 80 countries across the EMEA, LATAM and APAC regions, and will be further rolled out across North America during 2022"

Check with Transaction Cost Analysis,2012-11-30,,"The annual FX market turnover is some $4 trillion per day (Bank for International Settlements) and FX has been one of the largest sources of bank trading profits for many years. Yet it is all too easy to accept the FX rates offered. They need checking.
Klarity FX, an independent FX Advisory company, believes that you can only manage these costs if you Measure and Monitor them diligently. They use the following process.
Explicit and implicit costs and the data needed
FX Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) reveals the true cost of executing a deal. The Explicit Costs are reasonably transparent, the spread plus any agent fee. But what if the spreads are not readily available and reported?
The Implicit Costs are much more difficult to ascertain. There are three sources: market impact, delayed execution and missed trades which can be used to mask excessive spreads.
To carryout TCA, data is needed on each transaction, typically this will include:

transaction ID
payable currency and amount
receivable currency and amount
contract rate
trade date / time
settlement data
FX counterparty.

TCA analysis process
Klarity FX take this data and first check it for data integrity and then carryout a series of analyses: against market data dependent on request and input quality, proprietary spread modelling and statical analyses. The outputs from the process include: individual transaction breakdown by counter-party, FX territory, value analysis, statistical distribution comparison, significance testing, and benchmarks testing. These results are presented in a dashboard in a clear and concise report on whether the FX transaction costs are fair and reasonable, see figure.

The TCA results can be analysed by drilling down into specific results and working with the FX provider to improve costs.
Results from carrying out a TCA analysis vary, Klarity FX have typically seen improvements of 0.10% in the spread taken, that doesn't sound like much until you note that on a $100mln exposure that is a $100,000 improvement direct to the corporate or the pension plan"
7421,3191,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/banks-recover-75-of-defaulted-corporate-loans,Banks recover 75% of defaulted corporate loans,2018-04-11,,"A study on corporate loan defaults show that banks can expect to recover 75 per cent of a defaulted loan but often recovery can be zero, according to data from 50+ banks by Global Credit Data (GCD). In fact, the bank is likely to face an 'all or nothing' scenario when trying to resolve and recover defaulted loans from large corporate borrowers (those with turnover greater than €50 million).
Economic cycles also have a significant impact on loan default and recover rates, while the average time it takes to resolve a defaulted loan is around two years. GCD's report found that whether loans were secured with collateral or unsecured also had a determining effect on the outcome of recovery after default, while the characteristics of the collateral (type, value of collateral and loan to value ratio) also strongly influence the outcome. The report found that that collateralised loans and obligors produce significantly lower LGD than unsecured loans and obligors. GCD notes that: “This outcome supports common bank lending policies which assume that the taking of collateral will improve the bank’s position versus unsecured creditors.”
GCD is a non-profit association owned its more than 50 member banks. The organisation has been collecting credit risk data from banks since 2004. By measuring the recovery rate of bank loans to large corporates, and also the losses, or loss-given default (LGD) rate, GCD says it has created “one of the world’s largest sources of information on all aspects of LGD modelling for wholesale lending”. It notes that it bases its figures on loans that have been defaulted upon, which represent approximately 1 per cent of total bank loans, rather on models for predicted defaults.
GCD underlines the following three observations about the study and its findings:

Seniority and collateral are confirmed as LGD drivers (27 per cent senior unsecured vs 40 per cent subordinated unsecured at obligor level. The Total Secured LGD is 23 per cent).
LGD varies over time, indicating that there is a relationship between the economic conditions and recoveries.
Because GCD data comprises privately held loans, the data set differs from most other studies. Hence the outcome can be compared to, but should not be expected to be the same as, studies which focus on publicly recorded bond defaults, single country data or liquidation only data"

In the introduction to this year's report they claim: ""Benchmarking the practices and performance of one organization against those of others can be one powerful tool. Its value lies in learning from the success of others and leveraging that knowledge in order to modify actions or behavior to improve organizational performance."" Yes, but benchmarking can also be used to beat up corporate treasury departments when they don't meet these standards, even when there are real and important reasons why not. Surveys like this need to be treated with care.
Having said that, the 2011 survey results for the six months up to April 2011are interesting and sometimes rather funny. Some of the highlights results from the survey of 720 organisations include:

typical organization has 4.0 full-time equivalents (FTEs) in their treasury operations for every $1 billion in annual revenue while the benchmark organization has 1.4 FTEs. Privately held companies have a significantly greater number of FTEs on a normalized basis than do publicly traded ones. Companies in the services, information/communications, government and financial/insurance industries also tend to have a significantly greater number of FTEs.
typical treasury department manages and oversees relationships with five banks, but there is significant variation by organization size and industry.
typical organization develops a short-term cash flow forecast in 3.0 hours. By comparison, top performers accomplish this task in only 1.0 hour!!!
bank relationships: 25% of respondents increased the number of bank relationships during the six months to April 2011, the primary driver for this was 'access to credit'.
13% of respondents decreased their number of banks, the main reason was the economies of scale make it easier to maintain fewer bank relationships.
the most valued aspect of a bank relationship was the 'bank's understanding of the organization's business and operations' (78%) - as always.
greatest source of dissatisfaction with a previous bank was customer service issues.


 Carefully applied these results can be a useful aid for corporate treasurers"

In terms of risks, this is huge and has shocked business executives responsible for mitigating risks, from insurers to corporate financial risk officers looking to safeguard supply chains across the planet. France's president, Emmanuel Macron, said it best when he said “Make our planet great again”. 
World of finance drops collective jaw at Trump's Paris decision
Here are some of the reactions from prominent voices in the world of finance and business who have also criticised and commented on Trump's decision:

This Bloomberg editorial called the decision 'Trump's big Paris mistake' and opened with the lines: “Any rational, responsible business leader, faced with an existential threat to his enterprise, would take steps to manage the risk. With his decision to leave the Paris climate accord, President Donald Trump is putting the lie to one of his central claims: that he would run the country like a business.”
Goldman Sachs's chief executive Lloyd Blankfein tweeted: “Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the US's leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement""
JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon said: “I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment.”
And BlackRock's Larry Fink commented: “I do not agree with all of the President’s policies and decisions, including today's announcement to exit the US from the Paris Agreement which I believe is a critical step forward in addressing climate change.”
GE's chief executive Jeff Immelt wrote on Twitter: “Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.”
Cargill's chief executive David MacLennan said: “It is extremely disappointing. Exiting international accords like the Paris Agreement will negatively impact trade, economic vitality, the state of our environment and relationships amongst the world community.”

Support for Trump
But some voices from the US coal and energy industry were supportive of President Trump's move. Barry Worthington, the executive director at the US Energy Association said: “The US energy industry will continue to reduce emissions, Clean Power Plan or no Clean Power Plan, Paris accord, or no Paris accord"

Support for Trump
But some voices from the US coal and energy industry were supportive of President Trump's move. Barry Worthington, the executive director at the US Energy Association said: “The US energy industry will continue to reduce emissions, Clean Power Plan or no Clean Power Plan, Paris accord, or no Paris accord. A renegotiated plan will be far superior to the poorly negotiated agreement. We are confident that President Trump took the right step today, putting US interests first.”
The Paris Accord and its weaknesses
The Paris Agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in the year 2020. It was a consensus that was hard-won after many rounds of talks. The final text of the accord has been criticised for lacking firm commitments from nations on the amount of emissions they will reduce to keep global warming below the target of 2 degrees C. The agreement lacks a binding enforcement mechanism to measure and control CO2 emissions, so reductions by each country are voluntary and climate experts say this won't be sufficient to ensure a slowdown in global warming. Trump says he can negotiate a better deal. Can he? Considering the difficulties of reaching consensus among 195 countries for the current Paris Agreement, this seems like an unlikely scenario.
Some hope
It's also interesting to note that Trump's decision is unlikely to increase his popularity at home, as almost 70 per cent of Americans (comprising a majority of people across 50 states) support the Paris climate agreement. Since the president made his decision known yesterday, a group of 10 states have pledged their support for the Paris Agreement objectives and have committed to upholding it within their borders. These 10 states (California, New York, Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregan, Rhode Island and Virginia) make up 30.1 per cent of the US population, 35.3 per cent of US GDP, and 17.8 per cent of US carbon dioxide emissions"

Investors worry that issues at prominent crypto players could trigger a wider market shakeout, according to reports. Early London trading hours saw Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, trading just below the symbolic threshold of US $20,000, or “roughly the peak of its charge to its previous record in 2017.” On Saturday, Bitcoin fell as low as $17,592.78, falling below $20,000 for the first time since December 2020. Reports indicate that in the latest cryptocurrency collapse, it has lost nearly 60% of its value this year and 37% this month alone. According to market participants, further declines could force other crypto investors to sell their holdings to meet margin calls and cover losses. Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund, is considering selling assets and seeking a bailout from another firm. Babel Finance, Asia-based crypto lender, and Celsius Network, a US-based lender, have both announced they will suspend withdrawals. According to Adam Farthing, Chief Risk Officer for Japan at cryptocurrency liquidity provider B2C2, ""there is a lot of credit being withdrawn from the system and if lenders have to absorb losses from Celsius and Three Arrows, they will reduce the size of their future loan books, which means that the entire amount of credit available in the crypto ecosystem is much reduced."" Smaller tokens were also impacted, such as Ether, which was trading at $1,075, after falling below its own symbolic level of $1,000 over the weekend. The decline in crypto markets has coincided with a decline in equities, with US stocks suffering their biggest weekly percentage decline in two years on fears of rising interest rates and the growing likelihood of a recession, stated reports. Bitcoin's movements have reportedly been similar to those of other risk assets such as tech stocks. According to price site Coinmarketcap, the overall crypto market capitalisation is around $877 billion, down from a peak of $2.9 trillion in November 2021. Reports show that a drop in stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value, suggests that investors are withdrawing funds from the sector as a whole"

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is expected to approve the plan, which is the latest indication that Ant, a tech powerhouse with financial activities spanning from wealth management to payments, is about to emerge from regulatory restrictions. The PBOC accepted Ant's application this month amid investor hopes that Chinese regulators are easing restrictions on private enterprises. While Ant has reportedly been working with financial regulators for months on a major overhaul, the central bank's agreement to review the application indicates that the company may soon receive its long-awaited license. China's central management has reportedly given Ant, an affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, a tentative green light to restart its IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong. Ant is reportedly awaiting final feedback from financial regulators, particularly from the PBOC, on the setup of the financial holding firm before filing a preliminary prospectus for the share offering as early as next month. Reports indicated that Ant must obtain the critical financial holding license and complete its restructuring before resuming its “mega-listing.” The cancelled IPO in late 2020 served as the catalyst for the crackdown that quickly spread to other sectors, including property and private education, wiping billions off market values and causing layoffs at some firms, stated reports. Beijing, on the other hand, has reportedly softened its stance in recent months. Liu He, Vice-Premier, commented that the government supports the sector's development. In addition to the financial holding company license, Ant's personal credit-scoring joint venture has applied for a permit as part of the fintech giant's business restructuring. Ant has agreed to form the joint venture with three state-owned companies as part of a plan that will allow state-backed investors to own a combined 48 percent of its key asset – “a data treasure trove of over 1 billion users.”"

Reports indicate that BNP Paribas is interested in ABN Amro's retail and corporate franchise, as well as the opportunity to expand into Northern Europe. ABN Amro rose as much as 18.4 percent in Amsterdam, trading up more than 12 percent to 11.55 euros. This year, the stock has dropped about 10%, giving the bank a market value of US $11.45 billion. The Dutch government reportedly asked NLFI, which holds the ABN Amro stake on behalf of the state, for advice on a potential further sale of shares in the bank earlier this year. The Dutch finance ministry did not comment on specific considerations about a sale. BNP Paribas, the eurozone's largest bank, will reportedly have additional capital for a deal after agreeing to sell its Bank of the West unit to Bank of Montreal for $16 billion in cash. The sale of its retail business in the United States is expected to close this year. BNP Paribas executives have committed to a 4-billion-euro stock buyback for shareholders, with the excess funds going toward growth. BNP Paribas’ ability to make a larger purchase was advanced in May 2022 when global regulators agreed that cross-border exposures within the EU can be treated as domestic exposures, which are deemed less risky. According to Bloomberg, this move could free up funds for BNP because its prospective capital requirement would be reduced"

This new API connection reportedly improves the user experience and removes the need for credential sharing, resulting in increased security and better privacy protection of its users. Peter Tilton, Chief Digital Officer, Personal & Commercial Banking, RBC, commented that “While our clients want their primary banking connection with RBC, they also want to be empowered with the ability to access, use and share their financial data with applications outside of the bank.” RBC's collaboration with Plaid, an API-first company, will significantly reduce the need for credentials when sharing financial information in Canada, said reports. This additional layer of security is said to come at an opportune time, as privacy is a top priority right now, and fraud attempts are continuously on the rise. According to RBC's 2022 Fraud Prevention Month Poll, 48 percent of respondents believe fraudsters have targeted them since the pandemic began, up from 22 percent in 2021. Plaid's data connectivity solutions are said to enable customers to connect to the company's network of over 6,000 fintech applications, including nine of the top ten most downloaded fintech apps from Android and the App Store, in an easy and secure manner. Consumers will be able to access various financial wellness applications using these Plaid-powered tools.

7437,3199,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/half-of-all-reported-crime-in-uk-is-cyber-crime-or-fraud,Half of all reported crime in UK is cyber crime or fraud,2020-02-12,,"It was recently revealed, at the annual PIMFA Financial Crime Conference, that up to half of all reported financial crime is either fraud or cyber-crime. That this growing exponentially year on year, despite fraud being hugely underreported and only one in eight cases being investigated. Commissioner Ian Dyson of the City of London Police, emphasised this point at the event, by stating “75% of all fraud crimes reported are cyber-enabled - it’s now a lot easier than robbing a bank and the rewards are far greater.”
Warnings were given as a range of expert speakers from the FCA, the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau and HM Treasury, and more, who suggested that London is becoming the “money laundering capital of the world” and that detection is a prevalent challenge with external and internal auditing picking up 4% and 16% of fraud respectively and whistleblowing unmasking up to 40% of issues.
Further to this, the pace of technological advancement was also flagged, with the stark reminder that criminals often have equally sophisticated technology at their disposal as firms do, equating to a “technological arms race” to ensure the protection of firms and their clients from evolving new techniques and technologies. They stated that as our daily lives and lifestyles are becoming increasingly impacted by technology so too are the dangers of cyber enabling. Numerous ways to protect firms and clients were also discussed on the day from industry-wide co-operation in sharing information to new police and governmental efforts to issues such as training your staff and educating clients to counteract “the human threat”.
Over 100 delegates from across the regulatory, law enforcement and cybersecurity industries attended the event organised by the industry trade body and sponsored by Herbert Smith Freehills and Bureau Van Dijk, The agenda covered an array of financial crime issues such as anti-money laundering, vulnerable clients, cybersecurity whistle-blowing, market abuse and fraud.
The first panel of the day was on whistleblowing and included Hywel Jenkins, from Herbert Smith Freehills and Bruce Forbes, from Prudential. Jenkins stated that “whistleblowing reports are a good source of intelligence for firms and the regulators about potential misconduct"

Jenkins stated that “whistleblowing reports are a good source of intelligence for firms and the regulators about potential misconduct. Equally importantly, people feeling confident that issues can be raised without fear of detriment is seen as a key factor in creating the right culture within firms; this is an area of continued focus from the regulators and therefore high up the agenda for firms and their senior management.”
The next panel - with Alison Barker, Director of Specialist Supervision at FCA, Jon Cosson from JM Finn, Simon Mair from Brewin, and Craig Arnold from Redmayne - addressed how the financial industry can leverage technology to combat financial crime; Jon Cosson said “cybercrime lists high on most organisations Risk Registers and many businesses have deployed captive controls that meet the evolving threats. Whilst organisations continue to develop their Cybersecurity strategies, it is evident cybercriminals are focusing their attention to supplier chain and clients, which are deemed easier prey. Organisations are as strong as their weakest link, criminals and fraudsters are very aware of this. Businesses need to think beyond their perimeter and reach out to their clients, educating them and developing verified communication channels.”
“Machine learning technologies can help analyse normal patterns of business processing and communication and respond when anomalies occur. Businesses should look to adopt advanced and secure identity management and authentication between themselves, their suppliers and clients as well as improved information protection technologies. Increased coordination and education across industry groups and law enforcement will likely prove essential to make sure the defenders can keep pace with the attackers,” Craig Arnold went on to add.
Svetlana Rhodes, Head of Financial Crime Compliance and Deputy MLRO from the Close Brothers, spoke about the drivers of vulnerability - which can vary and be obvious or hidden, temporary or permanent, such as health conditions, mental health conditions, life events and so on - and how to protect them against the most common fraud typologies, such as Impersonation, abuse of power of attorney, account takeover fraud, internal fraud, pension scams, investment scams and more"

Rhodes also highlighted the importance of financial crime prevention from risk assessment and understanding your client base, policy framework, staff training, reporting channels, identification markers and more, she stated; “42% of pension savers could be at risk of falling for at least one of six common tactics used by pension scams.”
Max Bruce, Cyber Protect Officer - National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, spoke about the cost and scale of fraud, sharing that 741,000 crimes of fraud were reported last year, from up to the total value of £2.2bn in victim losses, with only 35% of reports from individual victims. He also highlighted that 86% of fraud was cyber-enabled; 33% by mobile/telephone, 13% online shopping, 12% email, and the importance of staying vigilant to growing mandate fraud. Mandate fraud was said to affect businesses year on year, with over 8,300 reports last year and a reported loss of £180m.
Susannah Cogman and Chris Ninan of Herbert Smith Freehills provided delegates with a regulatory update and Cogman commented “that the anti-money laundering space continues to see rapid regulatory change, with three new EU Directives in the last four years, renewed focus on national and international supervision, and a number of milestones in the implementation of the government’s economic crime plan in 2020. Firms need to stay abreast of developments and adapt their compliance programmes where necessary.”
This was further re-enforced by the speech from Catherine Kernaghan, Head of Counter-Illicit Finance & Economic Crime Reform at the HM Treasury who outlined developments in the fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence.

Commenting on the day PIMFA Chief Executive Liz Field said:
“The conference was a great way to gain some insight from the many experts in this field to highlight the importance of education and vigilance when it comes to financial crime. Technology is advancing every day, which, if mishandled can be used against us. Fraud and cyber-crime is rising and becoming more advanced. We will continue to work closely across the industry, including the City of London Police, the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, the National Crime Agency, the regulators and our firms to help tackle financial crime and help protect clients.”"

Microsoft ramps up financial services presence
The news from Standard Chartered is the latest in a series of connections that Microsoft has made with the financial services world over the past couple of months. Back in June, CTMfile reported on the partnership between SAS and Microsoft that focussed on analytics and AI. 
The tech giant has also announced a couple of high profile partnerships with banks. At the end of June, it was announced that BNY Mellon would collaborate with Microsoft on ESG data and analytics solutions designed to help investment managers better manage their data, improve the success of US-listed fund launches and support the customisation of investment portfolios to preferred environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. 
Additionally, as part of its digital strategy to collaborate with external partners, BNY Mellon has expanded its relationship with Microsoft to create data, technology and content solutions for investment managers built on Microsoft Azure. Three new offerings already launched include:

Data Vault: A cloud-based data and analytics platform that supports the rapid onboarding of data to provide greater flexibility and accelerate client innovation and discovery. Combining this with a scalable, machine learning approach to data quality, users can more quickly and easily interact with data to gain actionable insights.
Distribution Analytics: Takes advantage of machine learning to help asset managers better understand predictive market demand drivers and sales momentum for mutual funds and exchange traded funds in the US so they can gauge how to successfully gain market share.
ESG Data Analytics: Uses artificial intelligence to customise investment portfolios to individual ESG preferences with support from crowdsourced ESG data and demonstrability screens.

That partnership will see NAB Group and Microsoft share development costs and resourcing investment to architect a multi-cloud ecosystem that will host 1,000 of the banks’ applications to Microsoft Azure as the primary cloud, while ensuring the same applications can be moved to or run across a secondary cloud if necessary. NAB has already moved more than 800 applications to public cloud providers as part of its cloud first, multi-cloud strategy. NAB’s proportion of apps on public cloud will move from one third, to around 80% by 2023.
“The needs of our customers haven’t changed, but their expectations of how we deliver a more personalised service has,"" commented NAB group executive Technology and Enterprise Operations, Patrick Wright. “To deliver for customers, we need to invest in the latest technology, leveraging global leaders like Microsoft to help us bring new services to our customers, quickly and at scale. Together, we will improve the resilience of NAB and BNZ banking services and reduce development timelines for system changes and improvements, from six weeks to as little as two days.” 
Microsoft’s global engineering team is supporting the program, aware of the international impact it promises. Jason Zander, executive vice president, Azure of Microsoft said: “Through this strategic partnership we will collaborate and co-innovate with NAB - creating compelling customer experiences, and streamlining the bank’s own operations.”
Microsoft will also train 5,000 NAB and BNZ technologists as part of the NAB Cloud Guild programme, ensuring NAB personnel are equipped with the skills required.

7445,3201,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/striving-to-be-strategic,Striving to be strategic,15 September 2022,,"Seeking to emerge stronger from the Covid-19 pandemic, many organisations are looking to revamp their treasury functions to be nimbler and more aligned with their respective corporate strategies. “For several years we have been saying that treasurers need to become more strategic within their respective organisations and have a seat at the table to make strategic decisions,” says Claudia Villasis-Wallraff, Head of Treasury Advisory, Asia-Pacific, at Deutsche Bank. On this treasury transformation journey, Villasis-Wallraff stresses the need to break down silos between different departments and the value of better coordination in spotting potential risks. “The progressive companies these days are the ones aiming to break corporate silos”Claudia Villasis-Wallraff, Head of Treasury Advisory, Asia-Pacific, Deutsche Bank “The progressive companies these days are the ones aiming to break corporate silos. Treasurers that weren’t performing this strategic role in the past have been encouraged to do so, while other functions of a company such as procurement realise the importance of active participation by the treasury department,” she explains. “What we are seeing now is that the treasurer is taking the role as a custodian of cash and whoever wants to expend any cash, such as the corporate finance department or procurement team, needs to speak to the treasurer to make it an efficient process.” In many of these transformation projects, technology will play an increasingly important role, particularly in facilitating communication between different departments. “There are many fintechs today that are working on bringing full value chains together and creating ecosystems. Treasurers cannot manage exposures that they don’t know about and working with areas such as procurement can fill that information gap,” says Villasis-Wallraff. While treasurers have always turned to technology for help to eliminate inefficiencies, it wasn’t until the pandemic that treasury functions started to rapidly consider significant upgrades to their workflows to address such issues. “Due to the pandemic, some treasurers realised how much they needed to catch up in terms of technology and optimisation of their processes. These are the things they should have done after the global financial crisis,” she notes"
7446,3201,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/striving-to-be-strategic,Striving to be strategic,15 September 2022,Embracing the power of technology,"One area where treasury functions can contribute a lot to an organisation is making better use of internal information to predict future scenarios and prepare for volatility. “Data now is the new gold. It takes time to analyse that information and we are seeing a lot of software coming up that makes processes and decision-making in a corporate more transparent,” observes Villasis-Wallraff. “If a treasurer has access to purchase orders in real-time, they will better understand what exposure is going to come. They can better use internal intelligence to predict where money is going to be needed in the future.” From cash visibility to cash predictability, treasurers are slowly pivoting to machine-learning tools to better calculate the optimum cash position. “Real-time information is becoming a reality. Sophisticated clients are slowly adopting it. The concept of value of money will also change with this as you will have to care about intraday liquidity, which was not possible with the old technology a decade ago,” she says"
7447,3201,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/striving-to-be-strategic,Striving to be strategic,15 September 2022,Crafting an integrated treasury function,"Understanding the need for treasurers to become more strategic in their respective organisations, progressive banks such as Deutsche Bank are keen to assist. Specifically, they are customising their internal technology stack to be embedded with their clients. “We are working as a bank on getting connected to the client and really creating interfaces with their enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to solve for inefficient workflows. This is how banks are going to work in the future with corporates,” Villasis-Wallraff says, adding that there are surprisingly many corporates that are still talking on the phone to connect with their banking partner. Going forward, she is confident that many treasurers will step up to the plate and look for ways to interact with the procurement and sales teams of their respective organisations in partnership with their banks. “Whenever you see a survey in treasury, everybody answers that their pain point number one is having a sound cash flow forecast. Showing an accurate cash flow forecast requires investment in technology and in data transparency,” notes Villasis-Wallraff. If being strategic is the goal of the treasury function, treasurers need to harness the power of technology to break down nagging corporate silos.

It is at present less than 16 weeks to Saturday 1st February 2014. Most companies and banks have now abandoned their attempts to exploit the strategic efficiency and structural opportunities that SEPA represents. All resources are being focused on the race to be compliant. The latest EBA figures showed that only 7.8% of direct debits were SEPA compliant and just over 50% of credit transfers were SEPA compliant. This is a crisis or maybe not, we’ll see. Fudges galoreFudges, to make it easier, to comply with SEPA are starting to appear: waving requirement to submit XML 20022 files (Spain, Greece and Italy) some countries are talking about not switching off the legacy DD systems banks are saying privately (some in public) that they will continue to run their legacy systems for ‘some time’.In contrast, some countries are insisting that SEPA is complied with, e.g. in Finland it will be a criminal offence not to comply, in Cyprus there will be fines for finance directors of €20k. The one consistent feature is that each SEPA country is taking a slightly different approach. Conversion servicesThe conversion companies are having a ball as their approach is now the only viable route to be ready in time, as it is not possible to cut out, all the changes required (de-scoping). Indeed work to be ready for SEPA is work involved is still significant.Also some banks are finding that the costs of conversion have now quadrupled from 12 months ago as resources become increasingly scarce.Other corporates are adopting permanent conversion services from Tieto, B2, etc. as they strive to bank and payment systems independent.Corporate strategies for SEPA All companies have slightly different strategies for SEPA, and most realise that they must make sure that the key payments and collections are made after 1st February 2014.

But some corporate departments are finding that if Business Process Outsourcing is imposed and implementation rushed, it can increase costs and complexity, for example:

the costs in low cost locations become popular and costs can rise rapidly eliminating any gain
the BPO provider does not understand the business and much time has to be spent training them, and retraining them as the staff turnover in the BPO can be very high
developing tight and practical service level agreements is almost impossible
BPO providers cannot sort out any problems or unusual occurrences.

But many CEOs and CFOs, and other analysts are convinced that Business Process Outsourcing is the way to cut costs and just focus on their businesses on the critical, unique elements of the business. The trend to outsourcing is, at the moment, for many corporate treasury departments unstoppable, so how can they manage this process and get the best out of BPO?
Rajesh Mehta’s four principles
Rajesh Mehta, Citi’s Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions - EMEA, believes that, “Corporate treasury outsourcing should be about process improvement, NOT just cost cutting and headcount reduction.” He has found that in his long career that there are four critical factors in effective corporate treasury outsourcing:

only outsource processes that are not critical. (He believes that this is why agency corporate treasury was not successful because it often included critical processes that corporate treasury departments should have retained.)
the process has got to be ‘uncritical enough’ for it to be placed on a third party’s scale platform and that the process needs to be ’sorted out’ before being outsourced
outsourcing has to be part of the overall process of re-engineering the whole corporate treasury department and should not be purely based on cost arbitrage/head count reduction
there is typically a critical minimum processes that can be outsourced, i.e. some processes naturally and logically fit together and should not be split up. Identification of these process groupings is vital.

“Don’t put crap in a new wrap”

Identification of these process groupings is vital.

“Don’t put crap in a new wrap”
One well known corporate treasurer has found that biggest problem is that companies rush into BPO. They hand over the process to the BPO provider before sorting out and rationalising the process(es) first. He elegantly recommends, “Don’t put crap in a new wrap.” He believes this is a certain path to increased costs and all sorts of operational problem. It is, in his experience, the biggest sin in Business Process Outsourcing today.
But why do BPO anyway?
The outsourcing in some corporate treasury departments has become so poor that, they feel that if the outsourced process had been thoroughly rationalised and refined, and then automated, it would have been far simpler and cheaper to keep the process in-house. Indeed some argue that: once any process has been rationalised, refined and fully automated, why outsource it and have all the problem of managing a BPO provider?
Future of bank outsourcing
Recently Bank of America Merrill was the last bank to exit the agency treasury business, see. It came as no surprise as the economics and nature of the business did not fit with how the banks’ cash management is evolving. But that doesn’t mean that the cash management banks won’t be providing outsourcing services. Mehta believes that the cash management business is being re-defined with:

multi-national corporations focussing on standardising their transaction and payment processing and delivery by adopting ISO XML standards, etc. so they become bank agnostic
banks focusing on providing core data based services, e.g. cash flow forecasting, data enrichment and analytics services that have an impact on corporates’ liquidity management and overall exposures.

In the new bank services, Mehta expects that, “The services will need to combine data and services from many different sources and suppliers. Technology collaboration is going to be a major new feature of the new bank services.”

Based on transaction data
The service is based on metrics derived from actual transactions – derived from SWIFT messaging that supports the legal confirmation process for the global FX markets – rather than survey-based information and, according to SWIFT, this allows customers to make more informed strategic decisions. It states that FX transactions confirmed over SWIFT include more than 133 currencies across 219 countries and territories, which the organisation says is “the broadest and most complete view of FX market activity”.
'New benchmarks' for FX industry
The service, which also established “new industry benchmarks” is aimed at major market makers and was developed with input from a number of Tier 1 investment banks. HSBC's Frederic Boillereau, said, “SWIFT has a unique data set and the aggregated data and insights they produce are valuable additional information.”

7456,3207,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/the-shift-in-finance-leaders-priorities,The shift in finance leaders’ priorities,2020-08-04,,"A recent report from Euler Hermes has examined how much the Covid-19 crisis shifted European financial leaders’ confidence and priorities for 2020. Carried out before and during the Covid-19 crisis in the UK, France, Germany, and Italy, the survey found financial leaders being cautiously optimistic coming into the year but the pandemic brought about increased levels of stress and exacerbated worries around late payments. Moving forward, despite a shift in business priorities, technology remains a key focus for CFOs, but this must be conditional on protecting the business from risk.
Before the crisis, financial leaders were predicting better financial performance despite the threat of high political risk, the rise of protectionism and climate change. The two most cited reasons for optimism were growing sales and profits, driven by an improving European economic situation and the adoption of new technologies. Since the outbreak, their sense of optimism dropped significantly; with the percentage saying they felt ‘confident’ about the coming year falling from 50% to 36% and those reporting feelings of stress nearly doubled from 19% to 32% and the number saying they felt ‘scared’ nearly tripled from 9% to 23%.  
Preserving working capital is now the top investment priority
Prior to the pandemic, digital technology was the highest priority for investment. Since then, the way financial leaders view their priorities has changed and investment in new technologies is now overshadowed by working capital. The proportion of finance leaders seeing short-term debt, day-to-day operating expenses and management of large inventories as their main preoccupation increased from 17% to 30%. Preserving working capital is now their top priority.
Despite a potential temporary delay of investments in new assets in the short term, technology maintains a significant weight amongst finance leaders’ priorities, with 21% of surveyed people advocating for investing in digital technologies in May, compared to 22% before the outbreak. Participants continued to rank the need to understand technology highly as a key skill of a CFO (49%) after financial planning (67%), strategic decision-making (56%), and business plan development (53%).
Payment delays are finance leaders most pressing concern
Even prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, risks around payment delays and client insolvencies were prevalent - affecting respectively 47% and 32% of businesses over the previous year. Since the crisis, things have escalated further - with 65% saying payment delays had affected them in the past two months when asked in May"

Since the crisis, things have escalated further - with 65% saying payment delays had affected them in the past two months when asked in May.
On top of this, prior to the outbreak only 44% of businesses said they felt ‘fully prepared’ to deal with payment incidents and only 40% said the same for ‘client insolvencies’. Since the crisis, these figures dropped to 31% and 35% respectively, while global insolvencies are expected to increase by at least 35% at the horizon of end-2021.
Businesses that are well prepared to manage risks poised to emerge strongly
Ultimately, the interviews conducted show that CFOs predict the current crisis may cause a polarisation of the business landscape. Businesses that are tech-savvy, who can adapt the quickest and who have robust risk-mitigation strategies in place, will survive.
“Like many of the respondents to this report, I was positive that we would achieve our growth ambitions in 2020,"" commented Loeiz Limon-Duparcmeur, group chief financial officer and member of the Board of Management at Euler Hermes. ""Now we are in a different world. I strongly believe that every crisis represents a key turning point for finance leaders. Having some margin to manoeuvre during a crisis is crucial and requires a much more forward- looking view. For this, new technologies are fundamental so that the focus is on the content and not wasted on spreadsheets.”
This Euler Hermes survey is based on three phases of research. Phase one was an online survey, conducted in February 2020 of 847 financial decision-makers in the UK, France, Germany, and Italy, sourced via an online panel. Phase two saw a series of telephone interviews with senior financial decision-makers across the same four markets. Phase three involved a re-fielding of the phase one quantitative survey to measure in what ways and to what extent the opinions of financial decision-makers had been impacted by Covid-19. A total of 222 respondents were surveyed"

Global Top 100 companies bounce back from March 2020 lows 
As the Euler Hermes survey highlights some of the lessons learned by finance leaders, new analysis from PwC has shown that global equity markets have seen a strong bounce back from the low points seen in March 2020, but volatility remains elevated. This is according to a new quarterly update to the Global Top 100 companies by market capitalisation rankings, released by PwC.
The report notes that, most immediately, a disappointing reporting season for H1 2020 earnings could cause a re-evaluation of recession risks and associated stock valuations. Having decreased by 15% (US$3,905bn) from December 2019 to March 2020, the market capitalisation of the Global Top 100 as at June 2020 was only 1% (US$335bn) behind December 2019. By comparison, as at 30 June 2020 the MSCI World Index (representing large and mid-cap equity performance across 23 developed markets) was 7% behind December 2019, having recovered most of the ground lost in the first quarter of 2020. 
""With the significant volatility in financial markets, the world’s largest companies provide relative security for investors,"" said Ross Hunter, IPO Centre leader at PwC. ""The concentration of Technology and Consumer Services companies is a key driver of the Global Top 100 outperforming the wider market index. This is a challenging environment for all companies, but there are clear distinctions in the relative performance of different regions and sectors. I hope this quarterly review will provide  interesting insights into how the markets are viewing the world’s largest businesses as they  adapt to this uncertain landscape.""
Regional analysis
Global Top 100 companies from the US and China and its regions recovered first quarter losses in March to June 2020 - Europe and the rest of the world did not recover the lost ground.

The company says that the purpose-built secure cloud solution enables faster deployment and lower total cost of ownership, bringing sophisticated fraud analytics to all sizes of financial institutions.
The Actimize cloud-based offering provides end-to-end fraud management capabilities with real-time transaction risk analysis (TRA), cross-channel fraud detection, and multi-payment coverage, as well as fraud alert and case management functionality. The fraud profiling solution for PSD2 compliance combines expert-driven models and machine learning algorithms to produce what the company says is the best possible risk score with the lowest rate of false positives. 
Recently in the EU, the deadline passed for payment service providers (PSPs) to have their Payment Services Directive (PSD2) APIs available for external testing. FIs are now faced with meeting the full requirements for a 14 September live date for these APIs. Alongside this, the additional requirement of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) adds further friction that firms will want to reduce. This means some serious catch-up for those who missed the first benchmark, while presenting challenges for mid-sized institutions with fewer resources available to implement the process.
NICE Actimize says that its fraud profiling solution for PSD2 compliance offers the following benefits: 

Provides a real-time risk score for every payment transaction and enables automated decision making on alerting, delaying, and blocking, for example. 
Reduces the need for SCA through risk-based authentication controls and low fraud rates.
Allows FIs to meet PSD2 Fraud Reporting requirements and PSD2 profiling compliance under Articles 2 and 18 without significant build and IT investments"

Generally, there are two design formats for CBDC: token-based and account-based. A token-based CBDC is a cash-like instrument because it is a digital version of physical cash. Each digital currency is represented as a token with specific denomination. The only thing required is verifying the validity of the object used to pay – in this case verifying the authenticity of the token (is it real or counterfeit?), just like physical bank notes. Token-based CBDCs are not linked to the identity of the user. An account-based CBDC is not a circulating currency like paper bank notes or digital coins, but a bank-account-like instrument. An account-based system requires that each user of the digital currency holds an account with the central bank. An account-based model mandates a process for verifying or authenticating the identity of the account holder and their balance, akin to an electronic funds-transfer service that banks, companies and government agencies rely on to send or receive payments from their own accounts. Bank deposits or credit cards that can be used to make payments are other examples of account-based systems.

Critics believe that CBDC is too centralized and can boost government surveillance, particularly in authoritarian governments or undemocratic regimes that may infringe upon consumers’ right to privacy. Additionally, it could undermine the role of retail or commercial banks as consumers flock to place their deposits with central banks directly, rather than trusting their money with a retail or commercial bank.

The 2016 Payments Fraud and Control Survey, backed by JP Morgan, found that 73 per cent of US companies experienced payments fraud, based on 2015 data.
According to the AFP, this is the largest percentage since 2009. It found that 64 per cent of companies were exposed to business email compromise (Bec) scams and even those that were not financially impacted by payments fraud directly, still had costs in the form of security, cyber insurance and training.
Jim Kaitz, president and CEO of the AFP, said: “One of the toughest payments fraud challenges we are seeing is Bec scams, which are growing increasingly sophisticated and successfully infiltrating email systems at numerous organizations.”
Cheques are the most-targeted payment method by fraudsters but almost half – 48 per cent – of organisations were exposed to wire fraud last year. This is an increase from 27 per cent in 2014 and 14 per cent in 2013.

Is independence possible?,2014-11-25,,"How integrated with their suppliers and banks should the corporate treasury department be? Suppliers and banks love ‘sticky’ services that integrate into their operations with their corporate client’s operations. So the client is tied to the them for a long time, if not for ever. In addition, banks and suppliers are often trying to carryout more of their clients work to ‘free them up’ for the more value added processes and activities. For the corporate treasurer this has advantages:

it is much more cost-effective operations and work flows
it does free up time for more ‘value add’ work.

But over-dependence also brings problems:

what happens if the quality of service falls and the corporate treasury department want to change? 
what happens if the supplier/bank gets out this type of business, or they don’t want them as customers anymore, as suppliers and banks have done in the past?
the operational and counter-party risk can escalate dramatically to the point when the biggest risk in the corporate treasury department could be the TMS provider, or a particular bank, or the service provider of the remove servers that the corporate treasury department uses.

What to do about over-dependence
Although corporate treasury department cannot be fully independent, there are strategies and methodologies which can be used to minimise the downsides, the problems from over-dependence on any single supplier or bank which include:

manage and look after your relationships, see: ESB’s approach, and how Dubai Aluminium ‘tells them how they are doing’
avoid having just one supplier/bank, and, wherever possible, have an alternative, and let them know there is an alternative, i.e. keep them honest
split banks into Tier 1 banks (who are committed and provide funding) and Tier 2 banks who provide regional and other services/relationships
try and not mix your bank credit and transaction services business, so you change one without changing the other
if you have to have just one supplier/bank then, at least, have a researched exit strategy for getting out of the relationship
use the new message standards, such as ISO 2022, don’t sign up for any services based on proprietary standards AND insist that your bank or supplier uses them or you’ll leave, e.g"

Earlier this year, Mastercard added to its cross-border network reach with its acquisition of Transfast. This announcement complements the company’s capabilities by providing access to R3’s Corda ecosystem, which includes more than 300 of the world’s financial services firms, technology companies, central banks, regulators and trade associations.
Mastercard says that the partnership is the latest step in its multi-rail strategy, providing customers with unrivalled choice in how they move money. By combining R3’s expertise in blockchain with Mastercard’s existing payment systems assets, brand and distribution, the partnership is designed to provide increasingly innovative, value add services for customers, addressing factors such as high processing overheads, liquidity management and the existing lack of standardization and processes between banks and domestic clearing systems.
Peter Klein, executive vice president of New Payment Platforms for Mastercard, commented: “Developing a new and better cross-border B2B payments solution by improving worldwide connectivity in the account-to-account space is central to Mastercard’s ambition. Our goal is to deliver global payment infrastructure choice and connectivity as demonstrated through our recent strategic acquisitions and partnerships, including our relationship with R3. It confirms our commitment to innovation, both home-grown and through partnerships and acquisitions, to support advances and innovation in the increasingly complex global payment infrastructure space.”
David E. Rutter, CEO of R3, added: “We are excited to partner with Mastercard to help shape the future of the digital payments ecosystem. All institutions - large or small - rely on the ability to send and receive payments, but all too often the technology they rely upon is cumbersome and expensive. Cross-border payments can be a particular pain point. Corda was designed specifically for enterprise use cases such as this, and we look forward supporting Mastercard in bringing blockchain-enabled payments businesses across the globe.”"

Clients will then receive a daily line-by-line cost for each transaction in a single spreadsheet. A total cost of transaction is calculated allowing the client to assess their overall FX service. Andrew Woolmer, Managing Director of New Change FX said: “The creation of NCFX Umpire means that pension funds and asset managers can understand their transaction costs in absolute terms on a trade-by-trade basis, and on a day-by-day basis. This means clients no longer have to perform expensive post trade analysis at a later date or hire experts in foreign exchange to ensure that trades are being done fairly. Nor does the client have to change the way in which they trade as NCFX simply takes the information directly from the bank, broker or custodian’s existing trade confirmation systems. The client simply notifies their FX provider of the NCFX email address to be added to the existing confirmation process. Not just for pension funds and asset managersWoolmer believes that, “Essentially we have enabled anyone who does FX to simply add NCFX to the confirmation email or their trade summary blotter and we produce a daily summary of all their deals and their cost per transaction. Essentially the goal is to offer a very simple quasi-live TCA that is helpful to the users without disrupting their dealing infrastructure.”CTMfile take: Increasing transparency in the FX markets is going to cut banks’ and other FX providers’ profits considerably"

Even J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Dimon accepts that crypto currencies are coming.  According to Lagarde (head of IMF), cryptocurrencies could play a future role in updating the IMF’s own internal currency, a reserve asset named the Special Drawing Right (SDR), and she believes it will deliver “massive disruptions”. 
One of the disruptions, not often talked about, is how will corporate treasury departments manage the fundamentally different assets - fiat, crypto and commodities - together. An important example of how corporate treasury could do this is shown by the group developing the WAWLLET, .
WAWLETT
The executive summary on WAWLLET, begins;

“Imagine having a wallet in your pocket where all your assets live. Whether it is fiat, cryptocurrencies or even gold. Imagine being able to transfer funds across borders, instantly and at almost no cost. 
Now imagine you’re a bank or a financial service provider looking for ways you can participate in the fast-evolving world of crypto-based technology. Imagine accessing a new customer base and opening up new revenue streams. 
You’ve just envisioned WAWLLET.”

It has two parts – A Multi-Asset Wallet and the WAWLLET Platform.

Powerful and flexible multi-asset wallet enabling users to manage all their assets from a single mobile or desktop application. The wallet would have different pockets for  at, cryptocurrency and commodities (like gold) as well as one to facilitate card payments online. (This would be a Personal Financial Passport that is recognized, respected and valued by all the entities connected to the WAWLLET network.)
Platform which will support a global network of banks, exchanges and other  nancial institutions, bridging the gap between legacy mechanisms and blockchain technology as well as between traditional markets and crypto markets.

Card Pocket is designed to enable WAWLLET customers to spend their assets in any store that accepts an international payment card.
Crypto Pocket is designed to support all available cryptocurrencies, as well as the WIN token, designed to exclusively pay WAWLLET fees. The Win token functions as an in-app coin or token.
Gold Pocket is designed to manage the user’s gold commodity. (After the initial launch of WAWLLET, additional commodities will continue to be added.)

WAWLLET will integrate Banks, Cryptocurrency Exchanges, Commodity Traders and Vaults from each targeted jurisdiction, as shown in the chart below:

Bloomberg News reported that this is the first 'joint cybersecurity war games' held by the group of 18 payment processors – although it notes that “banks and brokerage firms have been holding cyber war games regularly since 2011, testing the US capital markets’ readiness for attacks”. The aim of this exercise is to uncover differences in the defences of payment processing companies and to agree on a definition of a cyberattack crisis.
The simulation exercise was held on Friday at IBM’s test centre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and some of the findings are due to be shared at the P20 payments industry conference in Atlanta later today (10 October 2018) in a presentation given on Wednesday morning by IBM's Gary Meshell, a financial services security expert.
One of the organisers of the exercise, Rob Johnston, chief information security officer for FIS, told Bloomberg: “We put competitors in the same room together, which initially they were hesitant to do. But they realised pretty fast how valuable such a gathering is. When there are multiple breaches in an organised attack, it’s better to coordinate the response.”
According to the report, the payment companies found that their definitions of a data breach crisis were different, as were their processes for reporting a breach to authorities. The goals of the simulation were to agree on a common definition and to streamline cooperation between government agencies and the payments industry, as well as discussing how to formally share intelligence about cyberthreats"

7482,3223,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/why-cant-post-trade-be-more-like-amazon,Why can’t post-trade be more like Amazon?,2019-06-28,,"Emma Johnson, Director, regulatory and market initiatives, securities services , Deutsche Bank

If we can order a washing machine from Amazon and have it delivered next day, then why can’t a purchased security be credited with similar levels of speed and efficiency? Deutsche Bank’s Emma Johnson explores how industry steps towards harmonisation and integration could create an Amazonised future for post-trade.
The influence of Amazon is felt keenly in many sectors and extends well beyond the retail sector. The reason is simple: it is held up as a paragon of how businesses can use technology to provide a world-class customer experience. Customers of Amazon can search, select, and purchase an item in minutes, with dispatch of the item swiftly confirmed. Often items will take just a day to arrive. This retail experience has fundamentally changed expectations of what can be delivered in virtually every field.
Treasurers, looking to manage their surplus cash efficiently by investing in securities, find however that there is a disparity between the slick, quick and advanced processes used in an Amazon transaction and those used in a securities transaction. Despite being transferred electronically, for instance, a purchased security does not arrive in the treasurer’s account until two days after the transaction is completed – a particular pain point.
To address these concerns, regulatory efforts, including the introduction of Target2-Securities (T2S), have attempted to harmonise and integrate the securities post-trade industry. While these measures have laid solid foundations, it is not clear that they will take us as far as might be expected. So what might an “Amazonised” post-trade landscape look like and what will it take to get there?
Imagining an Amazonised post-trade environment
While an online order of physical goods and a securities transaction are fundamentally different operations, aspects of the Amazon experience – including its single portal, guarantee of delivery and ancillary services – could be replicated in post-trade processes.
Going forward, for instance, it is not inconceivable that something analogous to the single portal could emerge. Central securities depositories (CSDs) could potentially outsource their settlement business to a single centralised system – such as a European CSD (ECSD), which would sit above the national CSDs to eliminate the processing-related barriers"
7483,3223,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/why-cant-post-trade-be-more-like-amazon,Why can’t post-trade be more like Amazon?,2019-06-28,,"Going forward, for instance, it is not inconceivable that something analogous to the single portal could emerge. Central securities depositories (CSDs) could potentially outsource their settlement business to a single centralised system – such as a European CSD (ECSD), which would sit above the national CSDs to eliminate the processing-related barriers.
The ECSD could then provide a utility function, which would guarantee the quick and efficient delivery of securities to the relevant parties – much like Amazon’s delivery of products and services.  Custodians, meanwhile, would continue to provide both connectivity to the platform and a number of additional products and services, including custody, asset servicing, lending, borrowing, asset optimisation and settlement, all offered as plug-and-play client services. The result would be a set-up with clear parallels to what Amazon does best, with concomitant improvements in terms of efficiency and user experience.
Solid foundations
The good news is that the foundations are already in place. The introduction of T2S as the European Central Bank’s (ECB) new securities settlement engine has played a pivotal role in the creation of an integrated, low-risk and low-cost post-trade environment. The new platform, which is both standardised and interoperable, is driving the industry closer to harmonisation. In terms of securities processing, for instance, the common functionality provided to CSDs under T2S may lead to domestic and cross-CSD settlement via a single T2S CSD.
Regulatory changes have been hugely impactful, too. The introduction of the EU Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD II) has helped improve investor protection, timeliness, speed and efficiency, while the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) has enhanced uniformity and standardised market practice.
In doing so, it is already bringing parts of the post-trade experience closer to the Amazon model. If goods on Amazon are not delivered by the anticipated date, the issue can be escalated to the retailer, leading the customer to cancel their order and purchase the goods elsewhere. Similarly, under CSDR, if a seller fails to deliver a security within four days the CSD can mandate a buy-in – enabling the buyer to repurchase the securities from a different source, with the original seller covering any difference in costs"
7484,3223,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/why-cant-post-trade-be-more-like-amazon,Why can’t post-trade be more like Amazon?,2019-06-28,,"If goods on Amazon are not delivered by the anticipated date, the issue can be escalated to the retailer, leading the customer to cancel their order and purchase the goods elsewhere.

The next steps
While the new infrastructure and regulatory changes represent a positive step, there is still a long way to go. Uptake of T2S has been lower than expected, with an average of just 600,000 instructions processed each day and cross-CSD settlement volumes remaining below 1%. Challenges remain with SRD II and CSDR, too, which must still contend with extra-territoriality: foreign investors will need to be educated on these new European rules to ensure they make the necessary changes to their operations, keeping all participants on the same page.   
Increasing T2S volumes is a vital next step in helping to lower the cost of settlement, while also incentivising investors to consolidate their assets in T2S markets. Regulatory work must also continue, with a particular focus on enhanced transparency throughout the entire chain. What’s more, new entrants to the securities market, such as fintechs or techfins, will need to be met with a robust regulatory framework. This will ensure that banks and the “next big thing” share a level playing field, which will help foster competition, collaboration and integration.  
New technologies should also be embraced. Distributed ledger technology (DLT), artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based services, for example, can make the collection, management and distribution of information far more efficient and effective. Increasingly, non-bank entrants into the custody space are leveraging these technologies – making post-trade a far more competitive environment. Going forward, this competitive atmosphere should be welcomed and will help to provide investors with greater choice and cost transparency.
The post-trade industry has already taken its first steps towards an Amazonised future. However, although the foundations have been laid, the edifice is yet to be built and the industry has a way to go before it reaches the levels of efficiency that recent advances have led many to expect"

What is an LEI?
The UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), describes an LEI as a code, which provides “a unique identifier for persons that are legal entities or structures including companies, charities and trusts. This enables every legal entity or structure that is a party to a relevant financial transaction to be identified in any jurisdiction.”
The FCA's website also states: “If you are subject to MiFID II transaction reporting obligations or are a UK branch of a third-country firm, you will need to ensure that your clients eligible for an LEI have one before executing a transaction in a financial instrument subject to the MiFID II transaction reporting obligations on their behalf, from 3 January 2018. These financial instruments include shares, bonds, collective investment schemes, derivatives and emission allowances meeting the conditions in article 26 MiFIR.”
No LEI, no trade
The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), through a subsidiary, runs one of the biggest LEI operating units (LOUs). The headline of this blog written by the DTCC's Ron Jordan spells out the situation clearly: “No LEI, no trade”. Financial institutions subject to MiFID II reporting requirements will have to use LEI codes for each client and include this information in transaction reporting. And it's clear that the LEI must be obtained before the trade is effected.
In the past few years, 511,000 LEIs have been issued to financial institutions and corporates across the globe. The framework for LEIs was put in place in 2012. The DTCC's Jordan writes: “It was intended to help address the challenges faced by financial institutions as well as regulators to identify complex relationships between securities and corporates issuing them.” LEIs are allocated by about 30 LEI operating units (LOUs) and the system is managed from an administrative centre called the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).
LEI benefits
But obtaining an LEI shouldn't be seen only as a bureaucratic burden – there are also other benefits for companies and financial institutions"
7487,3224,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/is-your-lei-code-ready-for-mifid-ii,Is your LEI code ready for MiFID II?,2017-09-27,,"” LEIs are allocated by about 30 LEI operating units (LOUs) and the system is managed from an administrative centre called the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).
LEI benefits
But obtaining an LEI shouldn't be seen only as a bureaucratic burden – there are also other benefits for companies and financial institutions. According to John Mason, of Thomson Reuters, using an LEI in financial trading improves risk management and transparency. He writes: “While LEI codes enable the unambiguous identification of entities, they also deliver a host of additional benefits relating to risk management, including, for example, improved transparency and visibility within global supply chains.”
Mason says that the adoption of MiFID II could double the number of LEIs in existence, adding that improving market transparency depends on a critical mass of LEI codes being issued. There is likely to be a rush to obtain LEIs before the 3 January deadline and companies should act now to ensure that LEIs are in place. The DTCC's Ron Jordan wrote that “the volume of registrations for LEIs may increase by 50% to 500% in the lead up to MiFID II implementation”. As well as obtaining the LEI, financial institutions will also have to ensure that they are able to store the LEIs in their reporting system and have the necessary maintenance procedures in place to ensure that LEIs are renewed on a timely basis.
Act now
However, many financial institutions aren't prepared. Mason adds: “Given this unfolding scenario and the fact that many institutions simply do not have a handle on which clients have LEI codes and which do not, many will turn to external providers for help.”
The DTCC's Jordan concludes in his blog (written in July this year): “The “No LEI, No Trade” requirement is unequivocal. With only seven months to go, firms that will be affected by MiFID II should obtain the relevant LEIs sooner rather than later in order to ensure they are well prepared for the transaction reporting requirements coming into effect in several months.”"

But can data generated and made public by the US's Internal Revenue Service (IRS) benefit corporate treasury departments?

As of 25 March 2015, the US's Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said it had 160,000 entities registered on its database. But the potential number of registrants is as high as 500,000, the IRS estimates.Each entity on the database is identifiable by its Global Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN), which provides information on country, status of entity in relation to group entities and the type of financial entity. The latter can include cash pooling structures, treasury centres, captive finance companies, in-house banks, factoring and forfeiting companies as well as hedging activities.This is useful market intelligence for banks, who can tailor their services by country. However, according to Corporate Treasurer, CFOs and treasurers can also make use of this information to “better quantify how many financial institutions of a certain type exist already, who they are, and type of financial services available in any reporting country.”Read more in the full article - recommended - here"

The research indicates that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a faster decline in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity across Asia-Pacific countries and globally during Q3 2020 than during the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.
Global M&A volume fell by almost a quarter (23%) in the first half of 2020, with a 20% drop during Q1 2020 in Asia-Pacific - two years ahead of the decline recorded during the global financial crisis. However, divergences in the M&A recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are emerging between Asia-Pacific and other parts of the world. For the first nine months of 2020, Asia-Pacific deal volume dropped by 8% year-on-year, while the decline in deal volume has been far more acute in the Americas (20% lower) and EMEIA (15% lower).
M&A activity is rebounding more quickly for some countries and regions in Asia-Pacific than for others. For example, China’s deal volume rose to the 2019 monthly average level in March and April 2020 and has remained relatively steady for the second half of 2020.
Early movers and bold decision-makers achieve better results
Reviewing transactions in the immediate period following the global financial crisis, EY research found that companies that were early movers and made bold choices on portfolio-transforming acquisitions saw a 26% increase in total shareholder return over the following decade, compared to those that did not.
Furthermore, companies that proactively reshaped their portfolios by taking steps to divest assets achieved 24% higher returns over the same period. The research also shows that companies that actively invested in their businesses through elevated capex and research and development (R&D) following the global financial crisis witnessed two-three times higher returns over those that took a more cautious approach.
“As lessons from the post-financial crisis period show, early and bold choices on portfolio-transforming investments, particularly acquisitions and divestments, can help reframe the future of a whole organisation and position it for growth beyond the crisis,"" said Yew-Poh Mak, Asia-Pacific Strategy and Transactions leader for EY. ""Dealmakers have demonstrated the ability to close transactions despite travel restrictions in Asia-Pacific"

""Dealmakers have demonstrated the ability to close transactions despite travel restrictions in Asia-Pacific. As borders gradually re-open, we anticipate increased transaction volumes in the coming quarters both domestic and cross borders.”
Industry and corporate reorganisation driving up Asia-Pacific M&A value and volume
Asia-Pacific countries and regions have experienced the impact of the pandemic in different stages. While China’s M&A activity has already returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, Australia’s monthly deal volume has only begun to gradually recover in the most recent quarter.
Japan’s M&A activity was relatively unaffected in Q1 2020 compared with most other regions in Asia-Pacific, but it has since begun to slow as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions and the resulting impact on business. While outbound activity has declined and many deals have been put on hold due to travel restrictions, mega domestic deals have driven Japan’s domestic M&A value to a 15-year high in Q3 2020.
Overall, Asia-Pacific saw high value deals reach US$392bn in Q3 2020, the highest third quarter on record - driven by domestic combinations and technology deals. In particular, mega deals over US$10bn in China and Japan increased deal value in Q3 2020, with a Chinese oil and gas consolidation representing the largest deal globally to date in 2020. A telecommunications giant in Japan is also taking private its mobile unit business, which could lead to the largest-ever tender offer for a Japanese firm.
Positive outlook in Asia-Pacific 
M&A activity in many sectors across Asia-Pacific has been resilient during the pandemic. Sectors that have experienced growth in deal activity in the first nine months of 2020 year-on-year include telecommunications (19%), life sciences (9%) and power and utilities (9%). The most active sectors in terms of M&A deal volume within Asia-Pacific continue to be technology, advanced manufacturing and consumer"

The cyber attack was directed at a number of banks that SWIFT has not identified. The attack focused on the banks' secondary controls and in the latest case it targets a PDF reader used by the customer to check its statement messages.
Tien Phong Bank foils attempt to steal $1.1m
In the latest twist in this increasingly complex story, Vietnam's Tien Phong Bank has said that it interrupted an attempted cyber heist that involved the use of fraudulent SWIFT messages. TPBank told Reuters yesterday that it received requests in late 2015, via the fraudulent SWIFT messages, to transfer more than 1 million euros ($1.1 million) of funds. The bank identified the requests as fraudulent before any funds were moved.
SWIFT malware troubles continue
All of this follows the Bangladesh Bank heist in February this year, in which $81 million was stolen. Despite SWIFT's attempts to defuse the situation with a joint statement with the New York Fed and Bangladesh Bank, the new information now being reported by Reuters suggests SWIFT's troubles are not over.
In its statement on Friday, SWIFT said: “Forensic experts believe this new discovery evidences that the malware used in the earlier reported customer incident was not a single occurrence, but part of a wider and highly adaptive campaign targeting banks.”
SWIFT says network, messaging systems and software not compromised
It also stated: “In the meantime we would like to reassure you that the SWIFT network, SWIFT messaging systems and software have not been compromised. The security and integrity of our messaging services are not in question as a result of the incidents.”

Together with climate risk management specialist Resilience Economics, S&P Global Ratings this week released a co-authored report, The Effects of Weather Events on Corporate Earnings Are Gathering Force, which looks at the prevalence and materiality of climate risk for companies in the S&P 500 index.
The report is based on public corporate research updates and earnings call transcripts from April 2017 to April 2018, but excludes data from financial institutions, including insurance companies. It found that:

In financial year 2017, 73 companies (15 per cent) of the S&P 500 publicly disclosed an effect on earnings from weather events, but only 18 companies (4 per cent) quantified the effect;
The average materiality on earnings for the small number of companies that quantified it was a significant 6 per cent;
Climate risk is a surprisingly prevalent topic of discussion for the CEOs of publicly traded companies, and management teams are becoming increasingly accountable for understanding and mitigating the impact of climate risk;
Evidence of the impact of climate risk is found across all sectors, geographies, and seasons.

S&P Global Ratings stated that the effect of climate risk and severe weather events on corporate earnings is meaningful. It added: “If left unmitigated, the financial impact could increase over time as climate change makes disruptive weather events more frequent and severe.”
The report also found that discussions of climate risk and its effect on companies' earnings are now reaching the CEO's office. It stated: “Of the earnings calls in financial year 2017 where weather was mentioned as having a material effect on corporate earnings, more than half (53 per cent) of these disclosures were made directly by the CEO. The CEO and CFO combined made 86 per cent of all disclosures of climate-related impact on earnings. Moreover, CEOs and other top company executives often cite climate and weather as a risk factor beyond the control of management.”
The charts below show that weather and climate have always been at the top of the agenda on executive earnings calls and that the CEO and CFO are the main stakeholders who disclose weather-related impacts. Also, weather is often blamed for under-performance, but is rarely blamed when company performance excels expectation"

To enable further growth and to pave the way for an independent future for Katana, ING Ventures will invest a further £1.5m alongside other investors, as part of a £3m funding round. Katana Labs ltd has incorporated in the UK and has its offices in London.
Katana is one of the currently 25 different innovation initiatives nurtured in one of the ING Labs in Amsterdam, London and Singapore. It is the latest start-up originated by ING that enters the scale-up phase, following other projects such as Yolt and Cobase. Katana uses computational power and a machine learning algorithm to scan the entire bond market systematically to detect anomalies, helping investors surface investment ideas and find opportunities faster. Katana is supported by investment teams at PGGM, a large pension fund manager in the Netherlands, and other asset managers which have been using the tool and providing ING with feedback and market validation since the design of the first prototype in January 2018.
“A growing number of clients discover the advantages of using advanced analytics in decision-making,” said Santiago Braje, former Head of Credit Trading at ING and CEO of Katana. “It enables them to work faster and more efficiently. Supported by ING, we managed to develop, test and validate the technology. Now it’s time to move to the next phase as an independent fintech, we are very excited about the opportunities we see in developing our platform further and expanding our client base.”

The Card fraud trends, threats and tactics report, by Javelin and FIS, identified these key trends in card fraud:

Criminals are increasingly opening fraudulent accounts in victims’ names. The number of victims of fraudulent card accounts in 2017 rose to 1.6 million from 0.9 million in 2016.
An increasing number of credit cards now meet the EMV standard, so criminals are focusing on less lucrative debit and prepaid cards. In 2017, roughly 3.4 million people lost control of their prepaid cards – nearly three times as many as the previous year, while debit card fraud victims rose from 5.2 million to 6.6 million. But the overall amount of cash stolen has been steadily falling over the past few years, from $9.7 billion in 2014 to $8.1 billion in 2017.
Breaches of all data, including personally identifiable information (PII) and card information, increase risks. The precipitous rise in data breaches means that nearly all consumers’ personal details are for sale on underground forums, increasing the risk that any customer can be affected by fraud.
Malware ranges from rudimentary software, such as keyloggers, to more advanced crime kits, which can include remote access Trojans and the ability to intercept ID data and circumvent identification and authentication controls. Criminals have also taken to conning customers and employees into releasing PII and granting access to accounts by phone, email, and even SMS texts.
As EMV becomes ubiquitous, fraud is shifting online, where it is more difficult for merchants and issuers to immediately prevent fraud.
The total time victims of spent resolving card application and transaction fraud more than doubled over the past two years, rising from 45 million hours in 2015 to 100 million in 2017. However, card application fraud is the more complex of the two to resolve, taking roughly 17 hours for victims to sort through details. That’s almost three times as long as victims of existing credit card fraud take working through their issues. This results, unsurprisingly, in those customers’ feeling frustrated and often quitting their banking relationships"

The one consistent feature, in all these developments, is they raise important questions about the future of the payments industry including: which players will win? who loses? what does the payment transaction cover? 
Circle offers free cross-border payments
Payments services provider Circle is offering its customers in the US, UK and Europe the ability to send and receive money across borders with no fees and no mark-up on foreign exchange (FX) rates. The firm also said it is now offering ""instant"" transactions for users that send funds between those countries.
""Consumers will not have to pay fees or foreign exchange mark-ups on payments sent to or from the US, UK and more than a dozen European countries,"" Circle explained in a statement. ""Payments can now be sent between US dollars, British pound sterling or Euros instantly and there are no fees at all and zero FX markup on exchange rates if sent using Circle.""
Banking Technology report that:

“The firm (sort of) explains how it can make this free. It points to Spark, its open source project built on Ethereum for digital wallets. It can run on private and public Ethereum blockchains, while being designed for compatibility with other distributed ledger technologies and runtimes. It hasn’t released the open source code for Spark yet, but it is working with unnamed “consumer internet and consumer fintech companies” on implementing Spark at an unspecified date.
In a duet, Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville, co-founders of Circle, say: “We don’t believe there is a revenue model for domestic or cross border consumer payments, and we are not trying to generate any revenue from those payments. Just as the internet entirely commoditised information sharing, data sharing and communications, we are on the cusp of that commoditisation happening in consumer payments.”

The upgrade comes months after Circle pivoted away from its bitcoin buying and selling services, though at the time the startup said it still planned to use blockchain behind the scenes.

Integrated payments
For decades many have argued that the payment is just one part of a business transaction. The transaction covers whole process. In an interview with PaymentEye, Carla Erlick, SVP Business Development at Paysafe, talked about integrated payments and the crucial role they play in supporting business growth
Carla Erlick explained that, “Integrated payments are the invisible force that underpin the one-to-many payments ecosystem; they allow Value Added Resellers (VARs), Independent Service Vendors (ISVs) and Software as a Service (SaaS) e-commerce platforms to provide a ‘one-stop-shop’ solution to their merchant clients. They do this by combining payment processing with other vital business tools – such as points of sale, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), accounting, scheduling, and marketing – within the confines of a single platform or application.” 
She believes that, “Integrated payments are going to be a hugely significant component for many payment processors – but probably not all. Some, like us, will choose to operate in this area and others will shy away due to the complex nature of the industry.”
The way payment service providers are covering the whole business transaction will have significant impact on payment systems development.

Not only this, “Amazon Prime Reload has another advantage for the retailer, as well – it may encourage people to load large lump sums into their Amazon Balance, in order to ensure they never accidentally pay for an item through their debit or credit card directly, therefore missing out on the cash back option.”
How to use plain normal business cards
Commerical cards have been one of the mysteries of the payment systems industry: why haven’t they been more successful?

“Banking partners can deliver a full suite of payment options across a firm’s geographic footprint, incorporating commercial cards into an overall working capital and payables strategy”.


CTMfile take: Payments are just one part of a business transaction. Why not make them free, even cross-border payments, if the fully integrated business transaction is profitable? We are now in the business transaction business, not the payment business. There is a role for business cards, even Amazon, the disrupter, still accept business cards, but for how long? Is there a long term future for business cards?"

As the total annual value of fraudulent transactions across Europe hits €1.8bn, the need to step up fraud prevention, particularly in card not present (CNP) transactions, has never been greater. Reducing transaction fraud is an increasingly convoluted and nuanced business, however, as factors such as the mass adoption of e-commerce, increasing cross-border payments, and the growing popularity of new digital payment methods combine to add new layers of complexity.
Nets Fraud Ensemble is an AI powered anti-fraud engine that assists fraud prevention teams to navigate this ever-changing landscape in real time. By deploying true machine learning (i.e. a system that identifies emerging fraud indicators as well as established patterns), it represents a step forward from the rules-based models that are currently in use across the international banking industry. 
“Although initiatives such as 3D-Secure have done much to make it more secure for people to shop online across Europe, the industry still faces challenges,"" said Sune Gabelgård, head of Digital Fraud, Intelligence & Research at Nets. ""Many issuing banks have focused on fraud prevention through consumer education, but the industry must also tackle the problem where it starts and where it is orchestrated by organised criminal enterprises: on the internet.
“[Nets Fraud Ensemble] brings security and value to issuers, merchants and cardholders by blocking fraudulent card-present and card-not-present transactions in real time, creating a real societal benefit by keeping illegally obtained funds out of the hands of criminals. We look forward to our continued collaboration with KPMG to stay ahead of the curve and prevent fraud throughout the value chain.”
The ‘brain’ of the solution consists of multiple models working together to analyse each individual transaction within ten milliseconds - the time frame in which a transaction can be safely blocked. The solution learns from the results of its analysis and adjusts accordingly, meaning the longer that it is operational the more fraudulent transactions are blocked, and the fewer false positives are granted. In initial pilot programmes, it reduced fraudulent payments by 25% within weeks and up to 40% in the long-term. 
The benefits to issuers extend beyond achieving significant reductions in fraud"

The Berlin Group – an EU payments standards harmonisation initiative – is due to complete the public consultation on 17 November 2017. The conference presented discussions on how PSD2 will affect the banking system, how it will achieve simplified requirements for access to accounts (XS2A) and enable third party payment service providers (TPPs) to deliver innovative solutions to customers using application programming interfaces (APIs).
Speaking at the event, Ralf Jacob, part of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, gave an update on the current status of PSD2. In particular he discussed the timelines for the regulatory technical standards (RTS) and explained the approach regarding APIs.
This blog by Vasco's Frederik Mennes says: “Regarding timelines, Mr. Jacob explained that the the text of the RTS is ready, and that it is currently being translated. The RTS is expected to be published around 25 November. In order to become official the RTS needs to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union, which should happen in late February 2018. The RTS will go into effect 18 months later, in August 2019.”
And it seems that the Commission has also found a solution to the disagreement over so-called 'screen-scraping', or direct access to customer bank account data by authorised TPPs. The fintech community and European banks clashed over this, with one side claiming that banning the practice of direct access would not be in the spirit of the new PSD2 regulation, while the banks raised security and authorisation concerns. For more detail see: Fintechs and banks clash over ‘screen scraping’
According to Vasco's Frederik Mennes, the Commission might have solved the problem by creating a new industry body consisting of representatives from both banks and TPPs, to determine whether an API-based interface is adequate. Mennes writes: “All in all, the approach proposed by the Commission largely favors API-based interfaces, and tries to do away with the practice of screen scraping, which is long overdue.”
It now remains to be seen whether this proposed step will be confirmed when the RTS for PSD2 are published on 25 November"

It found that 35 per cent of companies are using analytics to mitigate third-party fraud, waste and abuse risks in supply chains – up from a quarter of companies in 2014.
Problems such as fraud, waste or abuse are prevalent in supply chains – one in three companies in the Deloitte poll said they had experienced these supply chain problems between 2014 and 2017. The highest levels were seen in the consumer and industrial products sector, followed by energy and resources. Deloitte's Mark Pearson said: “Unfortunately, increased vigilance doesn’t translate into lower instances of fraudsters trying to perpetrate their schemes. Even the most advanced analytics users should work to constantly evolve their efforts to stem fraud, waste, and abuse in supply chains.”
Fighting supply chain fraud with automated invoicing?
Financial abuses can include bribery, bid-rigging and collusion as well as payment fraud. Deloitte's Larry Kivett said: “In the energy and resources industry, I’ve seen complex capital projects rife with bribery, bid rigging, collusion, fraud, and other schemes.”
Some of the strategies to mitigate financial fraud in the supply chain overlap with the treasury function – for example introducing e-invoicing systems can eliminate some of the human input, therefore limiting opportunities for fraud. Kivett adds: “Beyond reducing sole-sourced procurement to manage risk, supply chain executives can also prevent financial abuses by working to improve supplier invoicing timeliness, accuracy, and approval processes.”"

One of the main strategies to achieve these goals was to adopt a 'driver-based planning' approach. In other words: financial planning became far more closely linked to operational data and key business metrics. The company also moved away from using Excel and Access and implemented a single integrated corporate planning and analysis platform by Board, the company behind the business intelligence platform of the same name.
In this client case study Board explains that the implementation for Coca-Cola European Partners focused on the organisation's short-term forecasts, monitoring of its closing activities, its annual business planning and budget, consolidated country and monthly reporting, as well as organisation-wide supply chain consolidation.
And one of the senior managers involved in the transformation at Coca-Cola European Partners said that the driver-based approach meant that a large percentage of financial data from the supply chain could be automated. Coca-Cola's Ivan Evstatiev said: “Ten per cent of the input of our finance supply chain activities are based on country-specific business insights, whereas 90 per cent consists of pre-populated profit & loss outputs thanks to the value driver methodology and the automation of operational data input. We do not want finance people to struggle with all the tedious sequential steps of preparing a plan: we wanted to digitalise this area and that’s what we’ve succeeded in doing with the Board platform.”
One of the main benefits to come out of the implementation was a move to a much quicker turnover in terms of data transfer, from overnight updates of key metrics across the organisation, to data updates every 15 minutes.

Global challenges are driven by the inadequacy of current formats that banks and market clearing infrastructures use to exchange payment data.
From a regional perspective, the vast array of formats that have evolved at the clearing infrastructure level has proven problematic. Some of these formats are regulatory in nature, designed to uphold capital and FX controls that are mandated to understand the purpose of payments.
What’s more, Asia is notorious for having multiple payment and clearing formats, languages and regulatory controls. As such, reporting obligations require a harmonised approach. A case study from SWIFT shows how the adoption of ISO 20022 will help this. It will lead to uniformity in data exchanged between market infrastructure providers (ACH/RTGS), market participants like banks and end-clients.
“Corporates in Asia do not use ISO 20022 yet - reasons vary, from corporate priorities and resistance to change, to market infrastructures not supporting ISO, and clients not fully understanding the benefits that it can bring for their business” says Ankur Kanwar, cash product head, Standard Chartered, Singapore and ASEAN. ""We are educating our clients around the benefits of using ISO 20022 messaging formats to improve the payment experience when doing commerce with Asia, driving more prosperity via better and seamless payments."" 
ISO 20022: a cost/benefit dichotomy
While the adoption of ISO 20022 requires investment, the benefits are wide ranging. The new value creation through better cash management will drive new value propositions across the bank’s product suite in areas such as liquidity management.
From a compliance perspective, there is a palpable reduction in both the cost and speed of due diligence. With digital payments on the rise, and speed a critical KPI for retail/corporate clients, a unified and borderless payments language is critical.
The new standards also bring greater interoperability across various settlements systems and will drive down the cost of transactions. When it comes to the reconciliation of receivables, un-truncated and data-rich messaging allows for the simple tracking of payments end-to-end.
A watershed moment
Adopting ISO 20022 can pose technological challenges given the numerous systems required to process a payment"

For Standard Chartered, effective change management means synchronising various projects, upgrading or replacing legacy systems, and introducing new products to allow them to leverage the synergies that exist. This accelerates the timeline and helps avoid throwaway investment.
“It’s clear that there is great promise and we can plan to harness a great deal of returns from the significant investment in ISO 20022 the industry is making,” says Shirish Wadivkar, global head Correspondent Banking Products at Standard Chartered. “But only if we look at this not as a mandatory technology-led change, focused on adherence to minimal change standards; but see it for what it truly represents - a watershed moment for the global payment business.”"

1. Don't rely on your primary source of funding
If you're relying on financing from a bank or group of banks, for example, getting an alternative source of funding in place while business is running smoothly could be a useful strategy. This is how Nike managed to avoid a cash flow crisis in its early days, when its main line of bank credit was pulled – as described in this article How Nike survived a cash flow crisis. Author Tom Roberts writes: “Thanks to [Nike's founder Phil] Knight’s foresight to bring in a secondary funder, the Japanese trading company saw the potential of Nike’s business and stepped up with additional money to bridge its funding gap. The rest, as they say, is history.”
2. Look to your supply chain
Supply chain finance programmes can free up cash flows for both buyers and suppliers in the supply chain, by allowing the buyer to extend the payment terms and providing earlier cash payments for the supplier. Because supply chain finance programmes are off-balance-sheet, they enable companies to improve cash flows without increasing levels of debt. For more insight into choosing the right supply chain finance programme for your company, see this article Which Supply Chain Finance program is right for you?
3. Keep financial statements up-to-date
Having regularly updated financial statements won't avert a cash flow crisis but it will help to ensure you have an excellent view on your company's cash flow situation. It may even give you some warning of problems up ahead so you can prepare and put some back-up strategies in place to ensure you are able to maintain liquidity.
4. Focus on accounts receivable
Ensure your invoicing is up-to-date and that all invoices are sent out quickly. Other options to consider are reducing payment terms as much as possible and offering a variety of payment methods. Offering discounts for very prompt payments could also tempt some customers to pay ahead of the payment due date. See this article for more suggestions on how to make accounts receivable efficient: Seven tips for a happier financial supply chain 
5. Look around for credit
Your credit might have crunched for any number of reasons – a problem with customer payments, commodity price rises or the withdrawal of credit from a funding partner"

in countries like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, SEPA allows them to transfer money to the eurozone faster and cheaper than is currently possible. Hungary, for example, is even using the XML standard to harmonise their domestic payment structure, because there is a lot of trade between these countries and the eurozone
Poland, for example, has adopted the Dutch settlement rules. This means that companies are able to deliver transactions twice or three times per day, and they will be processed the same day. (The harmonisation of the standard is resulting in improvements in the payment system across Europe, not just in the SEPA region. (Russia is looking at adopting SEPA standards.)
banks and companies in the off-shore centres, such as Bermuda, are looking at how to make and receive SEPA payments; in Australia and China companies are having to do the same; etc., etc.

SEPA's impact is global. A sea change is happening to payment systems and standards. In 2023, we will look back and realise that SEPA was the catalytic event that moved the world to ISO 20022 standards and the rationalisation of payment systems right around the world"

The London, UK-based company, which was spun off from Delphi Automotive at the end of 2017, is one of the world’s leading providers of vehicle propulsion systems and has been actively participating in cross-border cash pooling schemes to support its China operations.
In March this year SAFE – the administrative agency that regulates China’s foreign exchange market activities and manages the state FX reserves – announced new administrative provisions on centralised cross-border fund management for multinational companies (MNCs), aka Circular 7.
SAFE amended the scheme with the aim of further enhancing the business environment in mainland China and facilitating cross-border fund movement. The upgraded scheme now increases the foreign debt quota of MNCs’ domestic participating members and allows for RMB to be the account currency for domestic master accounts.
Quick response
Under the new scheme, Deutsche Bank was able to set up an RMB domestic master account for Delphi Technologies to aggregate the foreign debt quotas of the company’s onshore entities in China, and support its capital expenditure (capex) and working capital needs. With this account, the company will be able to maximise the use of its overseas cash liquidity, while managing FX risks centrally.
“The recent changes in the SAFE scheme including quota expansion, currency and account management flexibilities will help multinationals like us to strengthen their China businesses,” said Carol Dong, Asia treasury manager at Delphi Technologies.
“We were impressed by Deutsche Bank’s policy expertise, and dedication to implementing the solution. With the new foreign debt centralised management scheme, we will be able to make better use of our overseas funds and expand our business in China.”
Dirk Lubig, head of global transaction banking China, and Greater China head of corporate cash management at Deutsche Bank, added that the bank's ""timely response"" to the new regulation resulted in a short time-to-market implementation"

SWIFTRef is SWIFT’s unique global reference data and financial information utility. Sourcing data from official data authorities and data issuers in over 200 territories, SWIFTRef provides the most accurate and up to date payment reference data. This data covers BIC, LEI, national bank codes and IBAN data, standing settlement instructions, credit ratings, as well as financial institutions’ memberships to domestic and cross-border payment market infrastructures. Enabling trouble-free payments processing and validation for financial institutions and corporates, SWIFTRef accelerates flawless payment processing, clear regulatory reporting, risk management and due diligence.
Strategic collaboration 
SWIFT and CIPS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2016, setting out plans for a strategic collaboration using SWIFT’s global network to expand CIPS user community. Reference data forms part of this cooperation with a focus on improving payment routes. The cooperation on reference data is expected to:

strengthen cross-border RMB payments efficiency
increase straight-through-processing (STP) for market players
greatly improve the customer experience. 

SWIFT has been working closely with China to support the country’s internationalisation agenda by supporting broader connectivity of the RMB, offering value-added products and services such as business intelligence or messaging conversion and networks, and working towards community engagement and standardisation.
Xin Zhang, General Manager, CIPS commented, “As CIPS is developing and on-boarding an increasing number of direct and indirect participants. Updated and accessible reference data is critical for financial institutions to identify the most preferred or efficient routes for a transfer, as well as to understand a financial institution’s membership to CIPS. We are confident the inclusion of CIPS data into SWIFTRef’s database will greatly support cross-border RMB transactions going forward.”

Roughly half of the companies are also seeing savings from emissions reduction projects, suggesting that it pays to adopt a green corporate ethos. But more needs to be done to engage partners within the supply chain.
A survey of 4,300 supplier organisations around the world, who sell to 89 of the world’s biggest purchasers, representing $2.7 trillion of procurement spend, found that:

52 per cent are integrating climate into business strategy;
49 per cent are reporting savings from emissions reduction projects;
47 per cent have set climate targets.

Need to engage supply chain partners
These figures show how sustainability, environmental and climate concerns are becomings central to business decisions in the supply chain. However, fewer companies – 36 per cent – are engaging value chain partners on emissions reduction, according to data from CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. This is an area that could see more cooperation and alignment between companies in the supply chain. Put simply, you may have green, climate-related targets, but are you purchasing from companies who have the same environmental goals?
“In the past, companies would talk to their suppliers and then leave them to get on with it. But there has been a realisation that this is not good enough. Now there is a much more hands-on approach,” a supply chain sustainability expert at PwC, speaking to Raconteur magazine.
80% of emissions in your supply chain
Scrutinising the carbon emissions and environmental impact of suppliers should no longer be a secondary consideration for companies. According to Dexter Galvin, head of the supply chain programme at CDP, the supply chain represents four times an average company's direct emissions. In other words, the vast majority – about 80 per cent on average – of a company's greenhouse gas emissions come from its supply chain. Galvin says: “Far too little is being done to engage supply chains, but there is a huge opportunity from doing so.”

The use of big data to track and analyse risks will help companies manage sustainability risk in the supply chain more effectively. Blockchain also has potential to be a game-changer in the supply chain, as it could form the basis of systems that can identify the provenance of individual items in the supply chain. Introducing stricter supplier requirements will also push green initiatives further down the supply chain, while industry initiatives to share resources and collaborate will also create supply chain efficiencies.

CTMfile take: From a treasury point of view, this is so important because, as the bastion of corporate risk management, treasurers should be looking deep into the corporate supply chain to see where the majority of risks lie.

These are some of the directions that financial services will take in the coming years, as outlined in a research note published by corporate and banking research specialists East & Partners. The research says that businesses will require more tech-led solutions for compliance, with treasury, cross border payments and risk & compliance presenting the biggest opportunities for technology innovation.
Here are 10 of the future developments discussed in the research note:
1. Sustainability disclosure becomes the norm
According to the research, mandatory disclosure of sustainability and ESG data will become a given part of reporting for all enterprises and part of loan applications for corporates. It notes: “Over the coming years we see sustainable finance and ESG criteria being applied to all areas of banks’ loan books with green lending becoming a core solution.”
2. Increased importance of FX risk management
East & Partners says that business FX – “the most fragmented and multi-banked commercial banking product” – will continue to be absorbed into more comprehensive risk management strategies, while bank-agnostic platforms will drive crucial change in the industry, as they enable corporates to link related accounts. The research adds: “Having their trade, FX and cross-border payment accounts available through one portal will streamline and simplify the lives of corporate treasurers, CFOs and business owners everywhere.”
3. Tech to improve risk & compliance
South East Asia is a key development ground for fintech and most markets are seeing more fintech-bank collaboration rather than disruption. The research adds that in the next few years, treasury, cross-border payments and risk & compliance are areas that will hold the biggest opportunities for business and commercial-banking institutions.
4. Supply chain embraces digital
From smart contracts and the Internet of Things (IoT) to robotics and big data, companies are more able than ever to track the goods and payments moving through their supply chains. East & Partners predicts that smart contracts will become more prevalent, as well single cloud-based platforms. Importantly, businesses are shifting towards paperless trade.

East & Partners predicts that smart contracts will become more prevalent, as well single cloud-based platforms. Importantly, businesses are shifting towards paperless trade.
5. Alternative finance on the rise
Alternative finance, in particular peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, crowdfunding and supply chain financing, will become more common and will specifically target the under-serviced small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) segment, according to the research note.
6. Bank value for corporate
With competition from non-bank financial institutes including fintech companies and specialist providers, banks may have to rethink their role in transaction banking. According to the research, banks should ask themselves how they can add value to the corporate relationship, grow their fee-based revenues, link transactional offerings to their broader value propositions and drive cross-sell. It adds: “The lack of cash visibility and the inability of treasury functions to accurately and quickly forecast their cross currency holdings remains a major pain point and opportunity for providers in 2019.”
7. Data-rich cross-border payments
According to the research, the search for fast, secure and frictionless payment solutions without compromising on security is very high on the agenda for global corporates. It notes: “Data and business analytics are becoming as important as the payment transaction itself. More than half of all large corporates recognise clear commercial benefits flowing from additional payments data.”
8. E-commerce exponential growth
The global e-commerce market is estimated to exceed US$2.5 trillion dollars within the next two years and, according to the research, some of the key trends shaping the next generation of successful merchant acquirers include: instant payments integration, simplified cross-border payments, real time fraud and security detection, application programming interfaces (APIs), open banking data sharing and digital currencies.

East & Partners see that balancing cash flow and liquidity needs with the requirements for new equipment will be a huge concern for CFOs and corporate treasurers in 2019 and beyond. It adds: “The trend towards asset financing as a specialised, standalone working capital solution as opposed to the traditional model of a transaction banking accessory will define the market in the next five years especially.”
10. Banks must work on relationships
The research notes that the numbers of corporates switching their primary banking provider is at a record high and that, despite the adoption of digital processes, banks must put relationship management at the fore. East & Partners adds: “In our view successful banks in the coming decade will be those that successfully augment innovation with a distinctively human touch.”"

All Wieland thought about back then was producing bells in Ulm in the south of Germany. Now, more than 200 years later, the resource he needed for his foundry is more important than ever: Copper plays a key role when it comes to electromobility and energy transition. Due to the intended electrification of large parts of the economy, the demand for copper is likely to be permanently boosted. (see Figure 1)"

Over the last three years, the revenue of the company has increased from €3.9bn to €5bn in 2021. The main driver for growth was a series of M&A transactions. By far the largest deal was the acquisition of US-based Global Brass and Copper Holdings (GBC) that was closed in July 2019"
7525,3248,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/connecting-cash,Connecting cash,21 October 2021,,"Source: Wieland Group While the takeover opened new business opportunities for the company, it also created challenges for the treasury department: “Following the merger, cash management in the US was split amongst roughly 10 banks. And none of them was a core bank of the Wieland group,” recalls Fabian Schwarz, Director Treasury & Corporate Finance at Wieland Group. To make it even harder for Schwarz and his team, the different entities acquired were all running on different ERP systems. “We were not able to leverage synergies, we had complex and unharmonised processes,” he explains. “And above all, we had no visibility or transparency into the cash flows and the cash movements in the North American treasury organisation.” In an industry where prices change quickly – copper is a publicly traded metal – not knowing in which bank accounts the money sits and not having access to the funds, can become critical. Therefore, Wieland decided to fully reshape its cash management landscape in the USA. It was the largest cash management project ever pursued within the Wieland Group so far and Deutsche Bank played an important role in making it a success. The project goals were clear: consolidate banks to optimize liquidity and release cash; harmonise systems by implementing a global banking platform, which is bank-independent and able to interact with different ERP systems and interfaces; integrate the newly acquired systems of GBC into the legacy Wieland set-up; and improve compliance and transparency"
7526,3248,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/connecting-cash,Connecting cash,21 October 2021,Concentrating cash,"The first step, Schwarz’ and his team took in 2019, was a tender among six banks to consolidate all the cash management products in the US. Wieland decided to work with two banks: Deutsche Bank, which at that point was only responsible for the export business the company does with European clients to the US, won the mandate for the accounts payable side. The accounts receivable business was awarded to PNC Financial Services Group. Deutsche Bank could provide all required banking services as well as all technical interfaces for the Wieland US organisation and the Bank was already an established and reliable cash management provider for other group companies"
7527,3248,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/connecting-cash,Connecting cash,21 October 2021,,"In a second step, Wieland introduced a target balancing cash pooling scheme enabling the headquarters in Germany to access funds from the US operations. “More than US$50m have been concentrated on group level thanks to the new structure. Before, this cash was split across multiple bank accounts across 15 US locations,” says Schwarz. Now, these funds are available to reduce debt on a corporate level and thereby reducing interest rate costs. Working with only two banks, Wieland could reduce its bank fee costs. “More than US$50m have been concentrated on group level. Before setting up the system, this cash was split across multiple bank accounts across 15 US locations“Fabian Schwarz, Director Treasury & Corporate Finance, Wieland Group"
7528,3248,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/connecting-cash,Connecting cash,21 October 2021,Harmonising systems,"From a technical point of view, the project was quite complex. In the past, Wieland used to manage banking activities manually. By shifting the US cash management business to Deutsche Bank and PNC, the copper specialist also wanted to streamline and harmonise communication. In other words, consolidation was key and getting rid of multiple e-banking tools was one of the key goals associated with the project. This was not an easy task, but at least the treasury department did not need to start from zero: A few years ago, the group had decided to implement the global banking platform of SAP, the bank communication manager (BCM), and the multi bank connectivity (MBC) service for its European cash management activities. In October 2020, the company began to roll out these tools to the US operations as well. However, simple copy-paste was not an option, Katrin Steinbach, team leader Global IT Finance & HR at Wieland Group recalls: “In the past, we decided to use EBICS as communication channel. The reason for this was that all relevant banks were located in European countries supporting EBICS.” According to her, this was a “very safe and above all cost effective way of bank communication,” which is why Wieland did not consider connecting via SWIFT at that point. All of this changed, when Wieland started the cash management project in the US. SWIFT was now the best option to avoid several host-to-host connections which is why the company decided to onboard. “We only had six to eight weeks, because we were already preparing the first format testing, so we needed to apply and join the SWIFT network quickly,” Schwarz recalls. “This was quite tough because we are a German registered company and some legal documents were only available in German.” Yet, SWIFT needs that information in English. During and even before the whole SWIFT onboarding process, Deutsche Bank assisted with advice regarding the final structure and supported the technical side with various feedback concerning file and data structure in a weekly meeting which was held for several weeks"
7529,3248,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/connecting-cash,Connecting cash,21 October 2021,Using CGI format,"This was not the only technical work Wieland had to go through: Given the heterogeneous IT landscape of the newly acquired GBC business, the number of third-party systems that had to be connected to the global banking platform also increased. While some US plants are still running on the enterprise resource planning system SAP R/3, others are already working with the newer S4. Some entities are also using Oracle software. “Connecting all those different systems was a challenge especially in terms of processing different payment types,” says Steinbach. See Figure 2. “In our target structure, we are only working with the international CGI payment format”Katrin Steinbach, Team Leader Global IT Finance & HR at Wieland Group. A particular pain point was the implementation of a check procedure, as this is still very common in the US. Treasury needed new message types to deal with pay checks and lock boxes. “Furthermore, we had to standardise payment formats because in our target structure, we are only working with the international CGI payment format,” says Steinbach. In addition, this payment format was completely new to all entities involved"
7530,3248,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/connecting-cash,Connecting cash,21 October 2021,Lessons learned,"During September and October 2021, Wieland has come close to reach this target structure. As of October 2021, the whole North America organisation and large plants in the EU are using the SAP BCM as a global payment platform. “From the Treasury perspective we are very, very happy with the situation right now,” says Schwarz. Simplify the scope to avoid legal complexities: In hindsight, Wieland would not have tried to implement Puerto Rico at the same time as its US subsidiaries. The legal systems are similar, but not similar enough to managing implementation at the same time. Do not underestimate the time needed for KYC onboarding and bank account opening: Wieland chose new banks for its US cash management activities. On the one hand this allowed the treasury team to set up the new structure alongside its day-to-day business, without impacting this ongoing flow. On the other hand, each legal entity in the US had to go through the KYC process due to the connection with the cash pool master at the German parent company as well. Evaluate if physical meetings are possible and necessary: There are major differences between payment processes in Europe and the US. In hindsight, it would have been helpful to travel to the US and have several in-depth discussions and examinations of these processes. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic made this impossible. Allow plenty of time to train and onboard colleagues: Wieland involved the local colleagues very early on and gave them status updates. The company spend a lot of time in the training making colleagues aware of the system, making sure they understand how it works, and going through the first payments with them. Make sure to have one single point of contact to the bank: The number of people and parties involved in this project was huge (Deutsche Bank, SAP, SWIFT, the Wieland IT team). Therefore, the treasury department found it very helpful to have the key relationship manager at Deutsche Bank to coordinating all these activities within the bank and keep an eye on the bigger picture"
7531,3248,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/connecting-cash,Connecting cash,21 October 2021,Looking ahead,"With the successful go-live Wieland is convinced that the state-of-the-art cash management technology is in place and internal digitisation and process improvement goals have been fulfilled. A large part of the Wieland group is now running on one single cash management system, but harmonisation continues. The treasury team is currently focused on onboarding its Asian activities. “Our Singapore entity is working with Deutsche Bank to set up the new structure as well,” says Schwarz. At the same time, the first Chinese entity is about to get access to the platform via SWIFT as well. The company also purchased SAP’s In-House Cash (IHC) module to further improve and automate cash pools within the group. “Last but not least, we are also preparing the advanced payment management module to fine-tune the various interfaces we have due to the several ERP systems.”"

7533,3250,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/uk-business-investment-enters-recovery-with-positive-outlook,UK business investment enters recovery with positive outlook,2021-07-05,,"The outlook for UK business investment is potentially very positive as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19, according to a report by the EY ITEM Club. Following a 10.2% contraction in UK business investment in 2020, April’s EY ITEM Club Spring Forecast predicted investment will climb 7.1% in 2021 and 10.5% in 2022. The firm's latest analysis finds that, despite the economic impact of the pandemic, some sectors increased investment in 2020. Further, a number of factors have now aligned to create the potential for strong future UK business investment growth.
While the impact of lockdown restrictions and the pandemic contributed to some economic sectors - such as mining and quarrying (-52%), construction (-39%), and engineering and vehicles (-35%) - seeing significant falls in business investment in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a year earlier, other sectors delivered sizeable growth.
Efforts to combat COVID-19 with vaccines, track and trace, and distanced workplaces, a shift to remote working and learning, and the move to online shopping all helped push up investment in transport and storage (up 34%), education (22%), IT and communications (15%), real estate (10%), and the health sector (5%). As a whole, the services sector increased business investment by 6% between the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2020.
Looking ahead, the EY ITEM Club says that business investment is set to be further supported by the end of Brexit uncertainty in many sectors, sizeable amounts of cash accumulated by the corporate sector over the last year, the possibility of rapid consumer spending growth, government commitments to increased public investment and levelling up the UK economy, and the likelihood of continued historically low interest rates.
""The prospects for UK business investment are looking much better coming out of the pandemic than at any point since before the financial crisis,"" said Peter Arnold, an EY UK Economic Advisory Partner. ""In context, while the decline in business investment in 2020 was significant, it shouldn’t be over-emphasised: it was only slightly deeper than the pandemic-driven 9.8% fall in GDP. By contrast, the 15.3% decline in business investment in 2009 amid the financial crisis was three times greater than the 4.1% GDP contraction that year"
7534,3250,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/uk-business-investment-enters-recovery-with-positive-outlook,UK business investment enters recovery with positive outlook,2021-07-05,,"""In context, while the decline in business investment in 2020 was significant, it shouldn’t be over-emphasised: it was only slightly deeper than the pandemic-driven 9.8% fall in GDP. By contrast, the 15.3% decline in business investment in 2009 amid the financial crisis was three times greater than the 4.1% GDP contraction that year. A key factor supporting business investment this time around is that the pandemic did not limit bank lending in the same way that we saw during the financial crisis - instead, we saw the opposite. The banking sector entered the pandemic well-capitalised and funding has been readily available to support businesses and households. The economic effects of the pandemic have also been felt most in less capital-intensive sectors, like hospitality.""
Businesses are entering the recovery with cash to invest
The EY ITEM Club's analysis says that non-financial UK companies raised £77.7bn in additional finance between March 2020 and April 2021 - over three times the £23.9bn of net new finance raised in the 14 months to February 2020 - and issued equity and bonds worth a net £49bn.
Positively, businesses have already started to repay some of their new liabilities, with additional net finance peaking at £87.6bn in February 2021 and corporate net borrowing slightly negative in the 12 months to April 2021. And, as a share of GDP, corporate debt by the end of 2020 was still lower than the pre-financial crisis record.
The availability of finance, combined with government support and some businesses cutting spending on wages and other expenses during the pandemic, led to non-financial companies’ bank deposits rising by £129.5bn between March 2020 and April 2021 – an increase £111bn higher than if the average monthly increases of 2018 and 2019 been repeated.
While companies' cash holdings have fallen in past recessions, this time many UK businesses will find themselves with a significant amount of capital ready to invest in the recovery. They’re in a similar position to UK households which, overall, have built up a record savings pot. The availability of capital to invest is one of a number of reasons why the prospects for business investment are bright. That households have plentiful savings at their disposal combined with a revival in confidence bodes well for consumer spending"

That households have plentiful savings at their disposal combined with a revival in confidence bodes well for consumer spending. Fiscal austerity has been replaced by a focus on repairing the economic damage of COVID-19, which may create opportunities for businesses. Uncertainty over the future of the EU-UK trading relationship, which dragged on investment in the late-2010s, has been resolved, to a point. Against this backdrop, there is a potential for a higher-pressure economy in the next few years than the UK has seen for some time.
""The experience across different sectors will vary,"" commented Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club. ""Increased use of homeworking is likely to promote IT and communications spending, although sectors like commercial real estate may see less investment as a result. Meanwhile, the persistence of social distancing measures and the combined impact of Brexit and the pandemic on the number of foreign-born workers in the UK may lead to investment in automation across a number of sectors. While the picture for business investment is relatively positive, there are still grounds for caution. Higher levels of debt might affect future borrowing capacity and may mean investment is crowded out by higher interest payments. And, given the pandemic has capped off an unpredictable economic decade, psychological caution could run-deep, prompting a hesitant approach to investment even during the economic recovery. The key question is whether optimism can be sustained long enough for businesses to reset their expectations and factor in a more promising future. To help in achieving this, policymakers should be careful not to withdraw fiscal and monetary support too soon."""
7536,3251,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/how-mifid-ii-will-curb-bank-spending-on-research,How MiFID II will curb bank spending on research,2017-09-14,,"When the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) takes effect in the European Union from January 2018, research provided to investment managers will have to be priced separately from execution/trading, meaning that investment managers will have to pay separately for research and trading services from banks. This will be a change to current practice, in which banks provide research to their investment management clients as part of a bundle of services, with no explicit charge.
Consultancy Oliver Wyman says that one of the implications of this regulation is that the total amount of research produced/offered to clients is likely to fall. There is also a question mark over who will be paying for the research, which the firm estimates is currently worth about $5 billion.
According to this report from Bloomberg, a growing number of banks are saying they won’t pass on the costs to clients. But a natural consequence of banks absorbing the expense of research is that they will try to minimise that cost. Oliver Wyman estimates that the additional costs imposed by MiFID II could lead investment firms to cut spending on research by about $1.5 billion – or, the firm says, as much as $3 billion in the event of a price war.
Impact for corporate treasurers?
Michael Turner, partner at Oliver Wyman, told CTMfile that research unbundling will not directly impact corporates, given the regulation's focus on the investment side. He said: ""However, there are a few second-order effects that need to be considered, but unlikely to be of immediate concern."" Some of the secondary concerns will take time to be seen in the market and are likely to emerge in 2018/2019, according to Mr Turner. They include:

Reduced research coverage: As mentioned in the report, unbundling is unlikely to lead to wholesale withdrawals from research given the importance to other businesses and the barriers to exit. However, as providers focus on the highest value pieces they will reduce focus on the lower value areas. This will likely include smaller- and mid-sized corporates who are less traded and, as such, represent less available wallet for the providers. As such the reduction in research coverage could also lead to reduced trading and liquidity in these stocks.
Potential rise of non-independent research: some companies who experience reduced research may need to pay firms to provide non-independent research"

Linkages into advisory work: most equity capital markets offerings include independent research as part of the package of the deal. Corporates will need to assess the value of this research when considering who to choose to support them in the advisory work.

Key findings
The key findings of Oliver Wyman's research, Research unbundling – revealing quality and forcing choices, include:

research providers and investment managers expect to see a reduction of between 10-30 per cent in research spend, with some as high as 50 per cent;
to reduce operational complexity, costs and compliance risks, many investment managers plan to take this approach globally;
a key decision for investment managers is whether to pass on the 1-3bps cost of research to clients. If they do, they will need to justify the spend. Given the complexity of the decision, many are still undecided;
we estimate a combined reduction of spending on research and execution of ~$1.5 billion, potentially rising to $3 billion if a full-blown price war emerges, with the greatest impact felt by lower-quality research providers;
the overall impact is only a 1-3 per cent reduction on total equities revenues and not sufficient to lead to wide-scale withdrawals in research;
while small, the revenue pressure from unbundling will be a further challenge to profitability in equities, in an industry that has become heavily scale-driven. We estimate that over the last three years the largest four banks have captured 70 per cent of all profits available, up from 50 per cent in 2012"

Under the revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2), which will come into effect from January 2018, there are requirements for a general security upgrade for third-party access to bank clients' data, bringing an end to practices known as screen scraping. Amid some debate on the subject, the European Banking Federation (EBF) has made it clear that it supports the PSD2 requirements, which would end so-called screen scraping. But not everyone agrees and, last week, a group of European financial technology (fintech) companies asked the European Commission to consider revising its regulatory technical standards (RTS) for PSD2.
What is screen-scraping and why do banks want it banned?
The practice of screen scraping is often used by account information service providers (AISPs), which provide their customers with an aggregated view of bank account balances and account data. To do this, they need to use software that automatically collects information through a bank’s existing customer-facing online banking system. Crucially, it allows third party access without identification, which is why the European Banking Authority (EBA) confirmed in February this year that screen scraping would no longer be possible under the new RTS on strong customer authentication under PSD2. It said that the main problem with screen-scraping is that it does not meet security requirements under PSD2, which require that the flow of data between account servicing PSPs and third party providers (PISPs or AISPs) is not subject to unauthorised access and to ensure customer authentication details are confidential.
But the fintech companies who rely on this process say it is a secure, proven technology, also sometimes referred to as 'direct access'. The third party providers who use the process include payment initiation service providers (PISPs) and AISPs, which rely on screen scraping to access customer accounts and then deliver services to those customers.
Last week a group of 65 European fintech companies and associations sent a manifesto to the Commission, asking it to consider amending certain aspects of the current draft of RTS for PSD2, particularly with regards to allowing the practice of screen scraping"

Some say that the banks are concerned about losing their control over access to customer data and therefore losing their direct relationship and interface with the customer. But the EBF says that such services allow third parties to gain access to their customers' bank accounts by impersonating the customer, using their access credentials. The EBF has produced this video explaining its concerns:

The African Development Bank (AfDB) has successfully launched an Australian dollar (AUD) 155 million 10.5-year kangaroo social bond, due October 2032, marking its first social bond transaction this year. The kangaroo social bond – the term for bonds issued in Australian dollars by foreign non-domestic entities, including corporations, financial institutions, and governments – was launched on 14 April.
The transaction was arranged by Daiwa Capital Markets Europe, which acted as a sole lead manager. It marks the AfDB’s second social bond in the Australian dollar market, following an inaugural AUD social kangaroo issued in June 2021, which was an A$600 million 5.5-year bond and marked the AfDB’s return to the Australian dollar bond market after an absence of three and a half years.
The new issue also marked the first AUD social kangaroo to be exclusively issued to institutional investors in Japan. Two Japanese insurance companies, Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance and Asahi Mutual Life Insurance, participated in the deal.
“Africa is an importer of food from both Ukraine and Russia, especially wheat and maize, and the current geopolitical instability has led to a worsening of the food situation on the continent,” said the AfDB. “Combined with the rise in energy prices, this is especially distressing for the continent’s most vulnerable communities.
“By issuing social bonds to finance socio-economic development in its regional member countries, the Bank is advancing its mission and strategy to spur sustainable economic development and social progress in Africa. It is also capitalising on its track record of financing projects with strong social impact on the African continent.”
Proceeds from the Bank's social bonds are allocated to eligible projects that will have significant social impact and outcomes, leading to poverty reduction and inclusive growth in Africa. This is expected to bring socio-economic development and empowerment including solving food insecurity, improving access to basic infrastructure (electricity, water and sanitation, transportation), basic services (medical, education, vocational training), financial services, and job creation.
The AUD is the fifth currency in which the AfDB has issued social bonds since the establishment of its Social Bond Program in 2017, following deals denominated in euros, US dollars, Norwegian kroner and Swedish kronor"

Philippines plans CBDC pilot later this year
The Philippines’ central bank is joining others in trialling central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and will launch a wholesale pilot in the fourth quarter of this year, according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’  (BSP) Governor, Benjamin Diokno, who first announced plans for the project last November. 
Diokno stressed that Project CBDCph is experimental and has already signed up several major banks, although they were not identified and BSP is still looking to add more banks. A wholesale CBDC is restricted to banks rather than consumers or businesses and is used to facilitate faster payments and settlement for blockchain networks.
“And at the same time, we consult with our neighbours Singapore plus the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), for their projects on CBDC,” said Governor Diokno.
Last September, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) initiated Project Dunbar, an initiative to demonstrate that financial institutions could use CBDCs issued by participating central banks to transact directly with each other on a shared platform. This has the potential to reduce reliance on intermediaries and, correspondingly, the costs and time taken to process cross-border transactions.
Dunbar is a collaboration between the MAS, the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre, the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank Negara Malaysia and the South African Reserve Bank"
7544,3255,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/kangaroo-bonds-bounce-back-industry-roundup-fifth-may,Kangaroo bonds bounce back – Industry roundup: 5 May,2022-05-05,,"This has the potential to reduce reliance on intermediaries and, correspondingly, the costs and time taken to process cross-border transactions.
Dunbar is a collaboration between the MAS, the BIS Innovation Hub Singapore Centre, the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank Negara Malaysia and the South African Reserve Bank. As a cross border wholesale CBDC initiative, it is dubbed a multi-CBDC  (M-CBDC) project in which each country has a CBDC that is used for cross border payments.
In March 2022, Project Dunbar published a paper on its work so far. One of the issues addressed is whether central banks would allow foreign banks to hold their CBDCs directly or whether they would require a local sponsoring bank to hold it on their behalf. This is a central question as one of the promises of CBDC is to do away with intermediary or correspondent banks, which are regarded by many as the reason for the high cost of cross border payments and delays.
Last November, Singapore announced a deal with the Philippines to explore payment interoperability and cross border payments. At the time Governor Diokno said that Singapore would be the first ASEAN country to which the Philippines would link its payment system.
Cross border payments, particularly low-value remittances, are particularly important to the Philippines as many of its citizens work overseas. According to the World Bank, in 2021 the Philippines was the fourth largest recipient of inward remittances after India, China and Mexico. The figure for 2020 was US$35 billion.
The BSP also wants to encourage digital banks to develop in the Philippines, as it believes they can help empower the country’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).
MSMEs account for 99.6% of all business firms in the Philippines, the Governor noted during a recent virtual briefing, but while they are important contributors to the economy, many have experienced difficulties that have been highlighted since the arrival of Covid-19.
Diokno said that the problems include limited access to credit and poor digital adoption due to lack of access to digital and financial infrastructure. In response, the BSP has employed a wide range of regulatory relief measures to assist MSMEs,” he said. Most digital banks, he stressed, have tailored digital financial solutions to assist MSMEs in their recovery from the pandemic"

Filipinos are due to go to the polls on 9 May for presidential elections. According to Nicholas Mapa, senior economist for the Philippines at ING: “Although most candidates have expressed the desire to continue the programs of the incumbent, a relatively high debt-to-GDP ratio suggests that the eventual Presidential winner will not enjoy much fiscal space to pursue an aggressive spending strategy to fulfil campaign promises.”
Inflation, which until recently was steady at 3%, jumped to 4% in March and the figure for April is expected to come in at 4.6%, within the central bank’s estimate range of 4.2% to 5%. “The BSP Governor has remained steadfast in his guidance to keep rates unchanged to support the economic recovery but he has recently signalled he would be open to hiking by June,” Mapa added.
Last week Diokno confirmed that the BSP, which has kept interest rates at a record low of 2% since November 2020, would consider hiking rates at its June policy meeting to keep inflation in check.
Two Argentine banks offer crypto trading
Two of Argentina’s biggest banks have this week launched Bitcoin and crypto trading on their platforms.
Until now, Argentinians were only able to buy cryptos through wallets or directly from holders, but customers of Banco Galicia, the country’s largest private bank by market value, as well as the digital bank Brubank SAU, are now able to purchase cryptos such as Bitcoin, Ether and USDC.
Marcus Sotiriou, analyst at the UK based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said that the launch followes a poll by Banco Galicia, in which 60% of respondents asked for more access to crypto. “This may not come as a surprise to some, as Argentina has the sixth largest crypto adoption rate in the world, according to data and survey firm Statista, who estimate that 21% of Argentines used or owned crypto by 2021"

Banco Galicia’s online interface shows that it has begun supporting Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), and Ripple (XRP) purchases. “The fact they have included XRP is interesting, as it suggests significant confidence in Ripple winning the lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, who have deemed XRP a security,” said Sotiriou
At last week’s Crypto Bahamas conference, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed: “Ripple has partnered with several central banks around the world, some we've announced, some we haven't yet announced.”
Sotriou commented: “As the XRPL is the cheapest and easiest solution for cross-border payments, I am confident that many CBDCs and the like will be built on XRPL sidechains. Data from Kiffmeister shows that the jurisdictions where retail CBDCs are being explored is accelerating dramatically. I think CBDCs will be a major growth catalyst for XRP over the coming years as CBDCs gain more traction.”
Two Banco Galicia executives, Ariel Sanchez, manager of investment products and Nicolas de Giovanni, senior product manager said that the bank’s move into crypto was in response to particularly strong demand from younger investors. “They motivated us to push this project,” the confirmed.
In the face of Argentina’s recurring currency crises and rampant inflation – consumer prices in March rose 6.7% from a month earlier, bringing the annual rate to a 20-year high of 55.1% – two in three Argentines who invest in crypto say they do so to protect their savings from shrinking purchasing power.

Sidetrade reveals B2B global payment trends
Sidetrade, the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered order-to-cash platform has released its global payment trends findings drawn from the Sidetrade Data Lake and based on the payment behaviour of 20.7 million buying companies worldwide and more than 593 million transactions worth a combined US$4.6 trillion.
Global payment trends over the past three years suggest that US companies rank tenth in the world for lengthy payment delays, while UK and Ireland rank in the top five of Europe’s worst offenders. On average, companies around the world pay supplier invoices 21 days late – taking the length of time between an invoice being issued to getting paid, to a total of 53 days on average. Scandinavian businesses tend to pay the quickest overall, in particular Sweden, with a delay of just seven days, well below the global average.
According to the Sidetrade Unpaid Invoice Tracker, over two years on from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the US, France, and Italy still haven’t fully reverted back to their pre-pandemic unpaid invoice rates Conversely, Belgium, Spain, the UK, and the Netherlands now have better unpaid invoice ratios than before the start of the pandemic. France holds the title for the worst amongst the seven countries tracked, with 25% of the value of all overdue invoices as of mid-April 2022.
With a mean of 27 days for payment delays, the US ranks tenth globally: the US industry with the shortest payment delays being manufacturing with 22 days, while the worst industries are financial services and insurance (30 days) and leisure and hospitality (31 days). Across Europe, there are significant disparities in payment delays from country to country, ranging from Sweden’s seven days to Ireland’s 26 days late. On average, it takes companies in Europe 45 days to collect payment – a mean delay of 16 days.
Companies in the UK and Ireland are among the top four worst in Europe for payment delays – with means of 21 and 26 respectively – despite both countries having higher payment terms (34 days in the UK, 31 days in Ireland) than the European average of 29 days"

Companies in the UK and Ireland are among the top four worst in Europe for payment delays – with means of 21 and 26 respectively – despite both countries having higher payment terms (34 days in the UK, 31 days in Ireland) than the European average of 29 days. The UK industries with the shortest payment delays are utilities/energy at 19 days, and retail/CPG at 20 days. Industries in the UK with the longest payment delays are financial services and insurance at 25 days, and public services, HR services and transportation/logistics at 24 days.
Sidetrade’s tracker suggests that most UK industries appear to have recovered from the pandemic in terms of late payments, most showing pre-pandemic unpaid invoice rates. The exceptions are public services, other srvices and the Food industry. The latter has risen from 14% at pre pandemic levels, to 21% of invoice values being deemed late (10+ days after their due date) as of mid-April 2022.
France is amongst the worst performing European countries for late payments. Their sectors with the shortest payment delays are retail/CPG, and manufacturing, both at 17 days. The worst industries in France for late payments are leisure and hospitality, and public services at 24 days. France still hasn’t recovered from the Covid-19 crisis when it comes to late payments. The rate of unpaid invoices across every industry in France is still above pre-pandemic level, at 22.7%.
Sidetrade’s CEO, Olivier Novasque commented: “Protecting and accelerating cash flow has never been so critical as bad debt risk and inflation are dramatically increasing everywhere. This can best be achieved if companies harness enough customer behaviour data and become more forward-looking. Data science and AI are essential to fighting against late payment. Since each buyer’s payment behaviour is different, a dedicated and automated collection strategy is needed to be efficient.”

“Across the world, inflation is accelerating, driven by energy prices and supply chain disruptions. While both of these factors were already at play at the start of the year, the conflict in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, as well as recent lockdowns in key Chinese cities have further added to the inflationary environment and the outlook for price growth. These increasing costs for fuel, energy and raw materials add to businesses’ financial strain at a time when many are still recovering from the pandemic, making late payments more likely.
“Therefore, as businesses’ bills come due, often at higher prices than previously, many will find themselves having to prioritise which they can afford to pay immediately, and which will need to wait.”
Blockchain shipping group plans digitally enhanced trade finance
Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN) has announced its development of two trade finance products that will harness trusted data direct from the shipping industry.
GSBN, an independent, not-for-profit technology consortium developing a blockchain-enabled operating system for global trade, said that its Trade Finance Advisory Group (TFAG) has reached a milestone, with its first proofs-of-concepts for trade finance products since its inception last September.
Comprised of Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (BOCHK), DBS Bank and The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC), GSBN’s TFAG aims to build upon blockchain technology to digitally enhance trade finance, by improving the end-to-end operational efficiency as well as the transparency of data in the supply chain.

For Open Account, applicants can authorise their bank to directly inquire Bill of Lading data via GSBN’s blockchain-enabled platform for their proof of shipment. Similarly, for Letter of Credit, applicants can authorise their bank to use an electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) application built on GSBN’s platform to acquire relevant eBL information and instruct a title transfer.
“Trade finance solutions are among the first banking focused solutions under development in GSBN’s growing suite of products,” the consortium announced. “For small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs), these digitally enabled solutions enable accessible, fast and equitable access to trade finance.
“Meanwhile for financial institutions, this translates into better risk management, cost efficiencies and an overall better customer experience. GSBN has the long-term vision of integrating all products including its shipping product Cargo Release which cuts the time for cargo to be document-ready for release from days to hours, on its blockchain-enabled platform to deliver a one stop and unified user experience.”
Bertrand Chen, CEO at GSBN, said, “The global trade finance gap is set to reach US$ 2.5 trillion unless we harness technology to cut through the complexities and siloes between supply chains. Reaching proofs-of-concepts of trade finance solutions is a testament to the commitment and momentum of this group, that we are accelerating the development of scalable, real-world solutions to bridge this gap.”
Ajay Sharma, Regional Head of Global Trade and Receivables Finance for Asia Pacific at HSBC, added: “The need to further digitise trade has been made abundantly clear by the pandemic. By stripping out inefficiencies and removing friction, we can increase the volume and velocity of trade, decrease time to cash, and deliver other benefits that will improve the overall customer experience. HSBC is pleased to work hand-in-hand with GSBN and other partners to advance trade digitisation"

DBS and Xero partner on working capital solutions

Singapore financial services group DBS Bank and global small business platform Xero announced that they are working together to provide a simpler way to apply for loans and gain access to working capital for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Singapore and Hong Kong.
“The collaboration will enable Xero customers the option to share their transactions from Xero’s platform to DBS. In turn, DBS will be able to offer Xero’s customers hyper-personalised credit terms and working capital limits that are tailored to their needs,” a release stated
According to the DBS SME pulse check survey published in March, over 85% of the SMEs surveyed indicated that ensuring consistent cash flow and managing costs was a key priority for them in 2022.
Joyce Tee, group head of SME banking at DBS said: “Our regular engagement with SMEs has consistently shown that cashflow needs continue to be top of mind for our clients, even as business owners seek new growth opportunities.
“We will continue to integrate our touchpoints seamlessly into the customer journey, so as to offer our SMEs more intelligent and intuitive lending solutions. DBS has been sharpening our digital lending capabilities by leveraging ecosystem partnerships and advanced data analytics to roll out solutions that are hyper-personalised to each business’ needs.”
“Digital tools and solutions have been a significant driver in empowering SMEs to become more resilient and competitive, but working capital is the lifeblood of small businesses everywhere,” added Joseph Lyons, managing director, Australia & Asia at Xero.
“With DBS – our first banking partner in Singapore to offer API integrated bank feeds – we are excited to extend new offerings to our shared customers through SME financing. We look forward to continuing our work to further support SMEs with their financing needs, particularly in ensuring small businesses have the support they need to thrive”"

Citi launches SEPA instant payments in Europe
Citi has announced the launch of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) instant payments in Europe, expanding the bank’s global instant payments offering and enabling clients to pay to and receive from 36 SEPA countries instantly.
“The offering allows SEPA Credit Transfers to be made within seconds, 24/7 and funds available to recipients immediately,” said Citi. Payments can be made to and received from SEPA Instant participating banks located anywhere within the SEPA zone.
The new offering provides clients with a single point of access through Citi’s platforms, CitiConnect for Files, CitiConnect API and CitiDirect, for executing instant payments. With standardized connectivity platforms, clients will benefit from a scalable solution that can facilitate rapid global expansion within a consistent architecture.
Citi’s clients will be able to transact instantly with immediate settlement of funds and the capability can support new business models and ensure our clients can operate effectively in an increasingly real-time 24/7 digital economy. Businesses will be able to use SEPA Instant Payments for a wider range of use cases to drive business growth and efficiency, including on-demand payments.
Citi said that the continued growth of e-commerce business and direct-to-consumer business models make Instant Payments more relevant than ever. The new solution “offers corporates greater choice and flexibility in payment methods, with a frictionless and real-time payment instrument.”
Elena Gomez, Global Head of Domestic Payments, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Citi, commented: “We are seeing an increasing number of countries advance their digital capabilities and introduce local instant payment schemes. Citi has built a globally consistent solution that provides uniform connectivity to all key domestic instant payment systems.
“We have taken a single point-of-entry approach, utilising API connectivity, to enable clients to make payments in multiple markets, and access key real time services such as payment status or balance enquiries, as well as instant notification of incoming credits and outgoing debits.”"

The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated this sea change; hastening the decline of traditional cash by four or five years, increasing the need for digital cash and intensifying competition between companies and countries to develop digital currency solutions, reports Deutsche Bank Research analyst Marion Laboure. “The world has shifted from asking whether digital currencies will succeed, to how and when they will become mainstream,” she adds. In her latest white paper, The Future of Payments Series 2 - Part II. When digital currencies become mainstream, Laboure examines how cryptocurrencies are increasingly mainstream, forcing central banks – which are increasingly working on their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) – to join the race. “In the long run, CBDCs will displace private cryptocurrencies and become the norm,” she predicts. As per Figure 1 an accompanying survey of over 3,700 people in the US, UK and Europe finds at least one in three millennials expects cryptocurrencies to displace cash and credit/debit cards:"

Many have either only a limited understanding or no idea of how they work. Younger people are more likely to adopt cryptocurrencies more rapidly. As the report notes, while the number of blockchain wallet users worldwide is still relatively small it grew from 11 million in 2016 to 63 million by 2020. BRD (also known as Breadwallet), bitcoin’s digital wallet company, recently set records for the number of downloads, with CEO Adam Traidman telling Bitcoin.com in December 2020, “We’re nearing nearly three million users worldwide now”. 1 However, many overlook the dangers of bitcoin whose value has fluctuated sharply in recent years, along with other non-CBDC cryptocurrencies"

Diem is now “expected to launch later this year with a potential billion-strong community from the get-go.” PayPal, among the world’s biggest payment service providers with more than 300 million customers, announced in October 2020 that cryptocurrency capability was being added to its wallets.3 It saw strong early adoption and a bigger-than-anticipated waiting list in the US. The roll-out will, it says, be expanded internationally in H1 2021 and to the rest of its platform – including the Venmo mobile payment service – so users can complete transactions for goods and services leveraging their digital currency. Visa and Mastercard are following the trend. Visa CEO Alfred Kelly said that digital currency backed by fiat will be an emerging payment technology when Visa filed last May a patent for a “digital fiat currency” that indicated a CBDC use case. In December 2020, Visa partnered with P2P payments tech Circle to let card issuers integrate stablecoin USD coin (USDC) payment capability.4 Mastercard announced a card deal with Wired in July, under which Wired’s multicurrency Mastercard debit card users can buy, hold, exchange, and sell up to 18 traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies, and make free international ATM withdrawals up to a limit. Mastercard also launched a customisable CBDC testing platform in September. 2020 also saw the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announce in July that national banks can provide custody solutions for cryptocurrencies.5 In September, the OCC confirmed that banks can hold reserve deposits behind stablecoins.

Since then, and accelerated by the publication of Facebook’s white paper, Libra, in 2019 (now hosted on the Diem Association website after the change of name),6 central banks and governments have understood that cryptocurrencies are here to stay – and their benefits can only be fully realised when integrated into solid regulatory frameworks and financial ecosystems. Over the past three years, central banks and governments have multiplied and accelerated digital cash initiatives, reports Laboure. A Bank of International Settlements (BIS) 2021 survey found 86% of central banks developing a CBDC, with 14% already running pilot projects and 60% experimenting proof-of-concept.

Emerging economies generally have a wider array, especially when a CBDC aims to complement or replace cash. A CBDC could take two forms: retail: a widely accessible and public electronic currency available for retail transactions; and wholesale: a restricted electronic currency available only for large business transactions.

The latter provides connectivity in exacting ecosystems where hurricanes can cause power outages. The sand dollar bears low transaction fees, pays no interest and is restricted to domestic wholesale and retail transactions. Sweden, where cash in circulation has steadily declined since 2007, research on a CBDC began in 2017. In February 2020, Sweden began the first trial of its digital-krona project, the e-krona and the government could implement its digital currency nationally this year. In the Eurozone, the European Central Bank issued its report on a possible digital euro in October; the consultation phase ended 4 January 2021 and a decision on whether to proceed is expected mid-2021. The digital euro envisaged by the ECB was detailed in flow’s December 2020 article. In the UK, the Bank of England (BoE) released a CBDC discussion paper in March 2020 but has also yet to decide on whether to progress further. For the US, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the central bank is not concerned with not being first in the CBDC race and that the US dollar’s status as the world reserve currency already gives it a “first-mover advantage.” Nonetheless, in a 13 August press released, the Fed “highlighted the research and experimentation undertaken to enhance its understanding of the opportunities and risks associated with central bank digital currencies” and added, “The initiatives complement a broad set of payments-related innovation projects currently underway within the Federal Reserve System”.7 The Boston Fed is working with Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) researchers to build a hypothetical digital currency oriented for central bank use. Any code base developed from the initiative will be offered as open-source software for experimentation. The Fed has also assembled a team of application developers from the reserve banks in Cleveland, Dallas, and New York, who are working with a policy team at the Fed board to study “the implications of digital currencies on the payments ecosystem, monetary policy, financial stability, banking and finance, and consumer protection”"
7563,3256,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/when-will-digital-currencies-become-mainstream,When will digital currencies become mainstream?,February 2021,China leads the way,"In the report’s concluding sections Laboure considers what advanced economies must overcome for populations to adopt digital currencies. She cites two barriers: lower interest rates and cultural/privacy norms. Many still regard cash is regarded as a “store of value” and a “safe haven”. One in three Americans and Europeans name it as their favourite payment method, and more than half of the people in developed countries believe cash will always be around. Over the three months to May 2020, banknotes in circulation in the eurozone increased by a record €75bn – more than in the period following the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. “Higher interest rates are necessary to bring the end of cash as a store of value,” says Laboure. Deutsche Bank Research’s analysis of cash in circulation and interest rates within advanced economies shows a strong negative association between the level of central bank interest rates and cash in circulation. “Proving a causal relationship between cash in circulation and interest rates would require more work; however, we can say that low central bank interest rates certainly play a role in increasing cash in circulation,” she adds. With central banks in advanced economies lowering interest rates to near/sub-zero, inflation likely to remain low and growth depressed, consumers have little incentive to deposit or save money, so, explains Laboure, “moving cash from under the mattress into a bank account is unlikely to happen (at scale) in the near term.” Cultural factors related to convenience, usage, and privacy also influence adoption rates, suggests Laboure. While cash transactions do not generate digital data, digital currency transactions, although convenient, leave a traceable footprint. The survey suggests that citizens in advanced economies worry more about privacy than their peers in emerging economies. Only 10% of Chinese survey participants reported concerns about anonymity and traceability; other percentages range from 19% for Italians to 42% for Germans. This indicates a relatively swift take-off for the adoption rate of China’s government’s CBDC. The pandemic has accelerated an ongoing shift among younger populations from cash towards digital payments, particularly in Asia. At end-2018, around 73% of internet users in China used online payment services (versus 18% in 2008). According to the World Bank, 85% of Chinese adults purchasing items online also paid online. In other emerging economies 53% of adults making an internet purchase in the past year paid cash on delivery (COD)"

In December e-commerce giant JD.com announced that it will accept digital yuan as payment for products on its online mall, while Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Chief Executive, Eddie Yue, said that the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) and HKMA are preparing to test the digital yuan for cross-border payments. Evidence suggests that China’s CBDC is not built on a blockchain, the digital ledger used by bitcoin and other private cryptocurrencies. In August 2018 Mu Changchun, deputy director of the PBoC’s payments department, suggested that a blockchain platform could not provide the throughput needed for retail, which suggests that an electronic renminbi (e-RMB) will be centralised and issued first by the central bank to local commercial banks. China’s four major state-run banks – China Construction Bank, Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China - have started large-scale internal testing of the digital RMB wallet. Laboure reports that the digital currency plan will be backed by the central government and pegged one-to-one to the RMB. To initiate a payment, consumers and businesses download a digital wallet on a mobile phone and transfer e-RMB from a commercial bank account to the digital wallet. Users will be able to transfer the e-RMB seamlessly with their phones using NFC technology and the internet. Offline transactions – digital transactions that the central bank can’t track in real time – would be saved and processed once the digital wallet is back online. The offline feature aims to lend appeal for areas with limited internet coverage and/or access to commercial banks.

With bank accounts currently paying little interest people might opt to hold their money directly at the central bank, thereby disrupting legacy bank franchises and impacting financial stability. Were credit card volumes, interchange fees, payment transaction fees, and deposit interest margins to be seriously affected, it would shake the current two-tier system and create additional responsibilities for central banks, such as KYC issues and disputes; monitoring transaction levels; preventing money laundering and terrorism financing (AMLCFT); and tax compliance. It is for these reasons, that most central banks are considering measures to minimise the risk of disintermediation and the functioning of the two-tiered monetary system that provides the liquidity for the economic growth. As such, the digital currency model favoured by most central banks appears to be two-tier issuance. As with a traditional currency, transactions would be decentralised and supply would be centralised"

7568,3259,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/thomson-reuters-launches-corporate-responsibility-indices-an-objective-rule,"Thomson Reuters launches corporate responsibility indices: “an objective, rules-based benchmar",2013-04-24,,"Thomson Reuters, the world's leading source of intelligent information for businesses and professionals, has launched a new family of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) indices. The Thomson Reuters Corporate Responsibility Indices were developed jointly with S-Network Global Indexes, a New York based specialist index design firm, as an objective and transparent, rules-based benchmarking solution for measuring ESG performance. Thomson Reuters Corporate Responsibility Indices support Thomson Reuters vision to connect and enable the global financial community. They rate companies' performance and practices in the three key pillars of CSR investing: environmental, social and corporate governance practices. Unlike the majority of ESG indices, the indices mirror the performance of major global benchmarks via companies that have substantially higher ESG ratings than the weighted average for such indices as the S&P 500 or MSCI EAFE.
""Responsible investing is rapidly becoming central to the investment processes of large-scale owners of capital around the world, and these indices serve as rational benchmarks for measuring ESG performance,"" said Jason du Preez, global head, indices and symbology at Thomson Reuters.
The new indices are powered by ""dynamic"" ratings based on the Thomson Reuters ASSET4 ESG database. The Thomson Reuters Corporate Responsibility Indices employ a large array of indicators, each having different levels of importance depending on the industry, country and regional focus of a company's operations. The ratings include a greater emphasis on quantitative outcomes than on qualitative corporate statements to ensure the indices are as objective and transparent as possible.
The top ESG rated companies from each sector are included in the indices, which do not use negative screening to exclude certain industries. Thomson Reuters believe that this process results in more accurate and diversified benchmarks.
According to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), over $3 trillion in financial assets are managed by signatories of the UN PRI's framework. Adherence to ESG principles is widely regarded as a key indicator of the sustainability of companies' business practices.

How will these new indices affect corporate treasury? Is this another pressure on the corporate treasury department? Time will tell, but, for sure, the pressure for responsible investing is growing everywhere"

This was the overall finding of a survey of 277 senior British, German and French retail executives conducted by Oliver Wyman. The survey aimed to explore the risks and opportunities associated with GDPR, which comes into effect on 25 May.
The research found that:

46 per cent of senior retail executives in the UK say their organisation will not be fully compliant with GDPR when the law comes into effect;
this compares with 32 per cent in Germany and 39 per cent in France said their organisation will not be fully compliant;
71 per cent in the UK believe that data transfer poses a ‘significant threat’ to their organisation;
this compares to 65 per cent in Germany and 56 per cent in France;
a minority – 17 per cent – of executives across all markets view GDPR purely as an opportunity;
78 per cent report that owning, managing and working with customer data plays an important role in their business;
26 per cent say it is “fundamental to everything they do as a business”;
on average, organisations are devoting 10 employees, including six new hires, to GDPR in an effort to ensure compliance
56 per cent of executives say their companies are introducing stronger data security measures to increase customer’s trust;
40 per cent are exploring price and service incentives for customers who don’t request that their data is deleted or transferred.

Consumers unconcerned about data privacy
The impact of GDPR could be marginal unless there is a fundamental shift in consumer behaviour, warned Oliver Wyman's Duncan Brewer, who commented: “While UK retailers are taking GDPR seriously and investing resources in the lead up to the enactment of the EU regulation, it appears they are claiming to be less prepared and more likely to view the legislation as a threat than those in other European markets. Across Europe our research shows that senior retail executives are very concerned about data deletion and transfer. Yet it would require a fundamental change in consumer behaviour for retailers to be inundated with customer requests as we are seeing little concern for privacy among consumers. Most consumers are likely to continue to offer their data in exchange for improved services and convenience"

The Press Release announced that 'cheques will continue for as long as customers need them and the target for possible closure of the cheque clearing in 2018 has been cancelled'. It was not surprising given the outcry and the lack of viable alternatives for the many different users of cheques, such as: people who don't have and will never have a mobile phone, associations which have multiple signatories on each cheque, etc.
Following a year-long consultation with payment stakeholders, the Australian Payments Clearing Association (Apca) has just announced that it also sees no need to close the country's cheque clearing system. Although there has been a widespread decline in cheque use in Australia, with volumes dropping by 60% in the last decade and by a third in the past three years alone. Apca found a hard core five per cent of the Asutralian population to be reliant on cheques, comprising older Australians, those in rural and regional areas and industries such as real estate.
Just as in the UK, they are setting up a 'Milestones Project Steering Committee' in mid-2012 to monitor cheque decline and alternative electronic payment options.

 Alternatives such as the mobile phone payment systems, e.g. Barclays's Pingit, and many other technologies will need to be accepted and ubiquitous, before this hardcore 5% of users will not mind cheques being withdrawn.

Details released show that business activity in the services sector fell for the third time in the past four months and at the quickest rate on record in the index’s four year history. Business conditions across Australia’s manufacturing sector also deteriorated for the fourth successive month, albeit only slightly.
“The February ‘flash’ results imply a contraction in private demand,” said CBA senior economist, Gareth Aird. “Whilst this is clearly a disappointing result, it is not altogether surprising given the two negative shocks that have hit the Australian economy - the bushfires and the coronavirus.”
In February, the Flash Composite Output Index was down to 48.3 from 50.2. Readings below 50.0 signalling a deterioration in business activity on the previous month.
“Our main concern is that these events have hit the global and local economies at a time when domestic demand was already soft,” noted Aird. “The level of both the services and manufacturing PMIs highlights the need for more policy stimulus. With monetary policy doing most of the heavy lifting, an easing in fiscal policy continues to look the most appropriate response to support aggregate demand.”
The CBA ‘flash’ PMI is based on around 85 per cent of final survey responses and final indices for February published approximately one week later"

Findings show the services that corporate clients would be most willing to pay for are real-time cash balances (84%), enhanced security and fraud prevention (74%) and a single real-time balance dashboard across multiple bank partners (70%). The report also highlights the risk of customer churn as corporates do not expect to pay for services such as virtual accounts and ISO 20022 compliance support and would switch providers to access them.
Payments data monetisation
'Expectation versus Reality for Payments Data Monetisation' surveys 217 corporate treasurers and CFOs and 168 senior bank executives globally, providing insight into the business challenges facing corporates and their expectations for data-driven services, along with banks’ plans to address emerging customer requirements through payments data monetisation initiatives.
""Corporate clients are increasingly looking to their bank partners to help them run more efficiently, and this creates a number of opportunities for new revenue-generating services,"" explains Kieran Hines, senior analyst at Celent. ""Greater access to real-time data, including real-time forecasts, are high on the wish lists of clients, alongside enhanced security and analytics-driven tools to support decision making. However this is not the whole story, and there are several services that corporates want to access but are unwilling to pay for - in other words becoming ‘table stakes’. With many corporate clients looking to rationalise their bank relationships, banks should consider investing in new data-led services to both support client retention as much as to drive the top line.""
Bank investment required
Payments data monetisation is an increasingly key strategic priority for banks, with 38% reporting it as an objective of technology transformation investments. This is being driven by growing margin pressure and competition, evolving customer expectations and migration to real-time payment infrastructures and ISO 20022.
""The implications of this report for banks are clear,"" commented Toine van Beusekom, strategy director, Payments at Icon. ""Inaction is not an option and investment is urgently needed just to retain existing business and relevancy, let alone generate new revenues. But payments data monetisation is not a one-off product initiative, it is a strategy that must span the entire organisation"

This means that technology spend and transformation strategies must be directed towards doing the fundamentals extremely well and lowering the cost of delivering standardised, accurate and complete payments data in real-time. By doing this, banks can build the foundations that deliver the flexibility and agility to respond to the evolving needs of corporate clients.""
Ultimately, the report highlights that payments data monetisation is about more than revenue. The real opportunity is to move the relationship with corporate clients away from banking being about consumption of products, towards acting as true partners for customers.

In KYC the solution was not to demand everyone uses same standard. Instead Bloomberg accepted that today, there are no globally accepted KYC standards (and probably will not be for many years to come), and so built a KYC platform - Entity Exchange - based on this reality.
Bloomberg has changed the KYC business by accepting this fact and building a KYC platform - Entity Exchange - that focuses on providing a secure and streamlined way to provide sensitive documents and data critical to the onboarding process in banks and FIs regardless of which KYC standards and policies they use. 
Bloomberg believe that the problem that can be solved today is: “the provision of a simple and practical, efficient and secure platform for the exchange of sensitive documents and data required in the KYC process”, there is no mileage in trying to solve the lack of KYC standards. Insisting on everyone using the same standards just doesn’t work, as corporates around the world know to their cost and frustration.
It could be the beginning of the answer to Lenovo’s Damian Glendinnings famous rant at SIBOS 2015, where he listed many nonesenses in global banking that he was fed up of paying for, including, “We’re all providing the same documents 19 times often to different branches of the same bank.”
Entity Exchange service
Entity Exchange is a centralized, web-based platform that gives banks and other financial institutions a secure and streamlined way for their corporates to provide sensitive documents and data critical to the onboarding process. Bloomberg claim the result is faster and easier on-boarding for both parties, as shown below:

Banks and FIs can use this solution to manage multiple counterparty relationships through a single, secure platform. They can respond to requests for current documentation, give specific organizations permission to receive it and notify multiple counterparties about changes simultaneously.

Overall, the Entity Exchange platform, is, as Bloomberg put it, “Flexible enough to handle evolving regulatory requirements.” That is the key KYC change here.
Holistic approach to entity management
In any new business relationship all banks and corporates have to comply with regulatory requirements world-wide designed to prevent tax avoidance and fraud, e.g. anti-money laundering. Bloomberg has developed a holistic approach to Entity Management which combines the Entity Exchange functionality with Entity Verification to verify, refresh and monitor this information, and Entity Screening to uncover ultimate beneficial ownership, associated entities and C-level executives while screening for PEPS, sanctions and adverse media, as figure below shows:.

CTMfile take: Eliminating the key factors hindering the growth of your business is what KYC platforms should be about, not insisting on all using the same KYC standards and processes. This change could be a huge step forward to speeding up the whole KYC business. Entity Exchange is really what KYC is about"

In March, the US Treasury Department, along with other federal agencies, were tasked with examining cryptocurrencies/digital assets and the extent to which they are used for money laundering and fraud. However, it was noted that this is a large and complex task, and it will not be easy due to the growing number of cryptocurrency-related reports designed to identify this activity. According to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen), the number of reported suspicious activities related to cryptocurrencies reached approximately 92,000 in 2021, more than double the 42,782 crypto-related SARs received by the agency in 2020, which was four times the 10,377 SARs mentioning crypto in 2017. Fincen, the Treasury's money laundering prevention department, faces a rapidly evolving situation that may require specialists and resources outside of the bureau, stated reports. Additionally, Himamauli Das, Acting Director, commented that Fincen’s budget limits their ability to hire analysts, especially in the field of cryptocurrencies, to perform the type of analysis needed to understand how cryptocurrencies flow and contribute to illegal funding.

Now crypto investment levels continue to rise even during a current bitcoin price fall (approx. 16% down) as well as the tech-heavy Nasdaq benchmark (down 21%). With the rise of the virtual world metaverse and online decentralized Web3, the number of merger & acquisitions (M&A) transactions involving cryptocurrency target companies is also increasing worldwide. According to Dealogic, there were 73 of these transactions totalling $8.8 billion in 2022 year-to-date, an increase from 51 transactions totalling $6.8 billion in 2021"

Some central banks in EMs such as Brazil, Chile, Czechia and Hungary have halted their tightening cycles and many other could opt for the final rate hikes in the next month or two, the economist said. While central banks of Turkey and Russia have been cutting rates for several months, several countries running large current account deficits such as Hungary, Romania, Chile and Colombia could tighten more than expected in the current cycle, he added. India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), added an unscheduled meeting at the start of this month after failing to meet its inflation mandate and is widely expected to continue raising its policy rates when it next meets on 5-7 December. Capital Economics reports that EM central banks have historically tended to act quickly when a change of policy from tightening to loosening monetary conditions is necessary. In the past few decades, the regulators have waited around four months on average between ending their hiking cycle and delivering their first rate cut. The larger the preceding tightening cycle, the quicker the move to interest rate cuts, the firm added. India has raised its key policy repo rate by 190 basis points (bps) since early May and it now stands at 5.90%. Economists expect about 60-85 bps in further hikes over the next few months. Globally, the surge in inflation and a quick monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates higher. India's headline retail inflation rate fell to a three-month low of 6.77% in October from 7.41% the previous month on a favourable base effect, data released on 14 November showed"

Despite the fall in inflation in October, India’s inflation rate has now spent 10 consecutive months above the 6% upper bound of the RBI’s 2-6% tolerance band.

Analysts believe that the impact on Russia of monetary sanctions imposed by the West has persuaded China and some other countries to speed up their reduced dependence on the dollar. One report observes that “one of the worst-kept secrets in global central banking is the extent to which Chinese officials are swapping dollars for gold.” Although the People's Bank of China (PBoC) under Governor Yi Gang and his team have not disclosed their strategy it is likely to the clear policy trajectory Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pursued in recent years of internationalising the renminbi (RMB) as the top rival to the dollar. Xi’s policy has started to be adopted by other governments that detect a waning of trust in the dollar as global reserve currency and the need for an alternative to the dollar. This has been heightened by US national debt exceeding US$30 trillion this year for the first time, inflation at a 40-year high, the risk of recession as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates and US political uncertainty. Central banks that once hoarded dollars are buying gold in record amounts. In Q3 2022 central banks more than quadrupled gold purchases from a year earlier and added nearly a net 400 tonnes to already sizable stockpiles. The figures from the World Gold Council show that this year’s flurry of gold buying already well surpasses any 12-month period since 1967. They reveal that about 90 tonnes worth of purchases can be traced to Turkey (31.2 tonnes), Uzbekistan (26.1 tonnes), India (17.5 tonnes) and other developing nations. It is widely assumed that China is behind the other 300 tonnes. This year has also seen Beijing dumping US debt. In the seven months from the end of February to the end of September 2022, China sold at least US$121 billion of US Treasuries. Selling intensified around the time Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Since July, China’s imports of gold from Russia have increased sharply. That month alone, China’s gold transactions surged to roughly 50 times the year-earlier level"
7590,3269,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/emerging-markets-could-begin-rate-cuts-by-mid-2023-industry-updates-29-november,Emerging markets could begin rate cuts by mid-2023 – Industry updates: 29 November,2022-11-29,CLOs back in favour after short-lived selloff,"Global prices for bonds backed by leveraged loans have swiftly bounced back from a short-lived, UK-centred selloff that is changing investor perceptions about the US$1.2 trillion collateralised loan obligation (CLO) market, according to Bloomberg. It reports that in Europe, Ares Capital Corp and OakTree Capital Group have sold new CLOs this month although other debt markets, including junk bonds, have been largely moribund. New CLO sales since mid-September have exceeded €5 billion (US$5.2 billion). When UK pension funds dumped assets in late September to raise money to meet margin calls, they focused on the esoteric instruments tied to leveraged loans and effectively affirmed the market’s huge liquidity. That has now become a positive feature as credit broadly rallies. The drop in CLO prices due to liability-driven investing (LDI) -- the use of derivatives to match assets and liabilities -- is fuelling demand and an uptick in deals. Prices have returned to the levels that preceded UK pension funds’ woes. “The LDI selling has confirmed that there’s liquidity in the CLO market. They could have sold other holdings, but they chose CLOs,” Cyrille Javaux, portfolio manager at Fidelity International, told Bloomberg. “The spread widening that resulted from LDI selling has attracted buying interest,” especially from US asset managers. Prices reflect the relative liquidity of these instruments. While top rated US CLOs fell a little more than a cent on the dollar between mid-September and late October, high-grade European corporate bonds, which many investors would have historically viewed as more liquid, fell about four cents on the euro. Bargain hunters including Apollo Global Management and Blackstone made quick gains from buying CLOs in the secondary market, while European banks resumed looking at the market again. Meanwhile investors have kept buying, signalling that whatever concerns they may have about the economy in 2023, they have faith that the safest CLOs will perform well"

The research firm reports that CBA is set to become the largest primary asset finance provider in the Australian market in 2023, having topped the share of finance for vehicles and equipment by SMEs as well as commercial businesses, while significantly increasing its share with corporate customers. East’s annual asset finance market shows that CBA’s relationship share is gaining 7% each year and the bank ranks as the “most recalled brand”, performing best across 10 product and service customer satisfaction factors including relationship management, sales service, specialist advice, ease of use, innovation and pricing. Grant Cairns, CBA Executive General Manager Business Lending, said asset finance was a priority growth area for the bank in supporting business customers. “We’re focused on delivering tailored asset finance solutions to enable businesses, big and small to innovate and grow. It’s great to see this reflected in strong levels of customer satisfaction across a range of different metrics.” The report suggests that it comes amid significant growth in Australian asset finance, particularly among SMEs. Asset finance volumes have expanded by 10.9% in the past year, against the previous year forecast of 9.5%. Chris Moldrich, CBA General Manager Asset Finance notes that more businesses are investing in resilience and improving performance and productivity. “Businesses are facing many challenges with rising inflation, energy costs and supply chain disruptions,” he said. “We are concentrating on providing faster and simpler ways for businesses to access new equipment and technology to improve efficiencies and deliver greater value to their customers.”"

Citi has already revealed plans to purchase Deutsche Bank’s licence in Mexican so it can maintain corporate and investment banking operations in the country once it sells its consumer business Citi Banamex, according to press reports. Buying the license “facilitates the pursuit of our consumer exit and ability to continue our institutional operations in Mexico” a Citi source told Reuters. Mexico’s president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said last week that he approves of the two known remaining bidders for Banamex, after other potential buyers were derailed amid strict conditions imposed by Mexico’s leader. Recent comments by Lopez Obrador criticising Grupo Mexico SAB were interpreted by local media as indicating he was opposed to a bid for Banamex by mining billionaire German Larrea, who is the other remaining contender to acquire Banamex. While there is doubt over the future ownership of Citi's Mexico retail operation, HSBC continues to invest in its ambitious expansion plans for the country. Pablo Elek, head of wealth and personal banking for HSBC Mexico, has told Euromoney that the country is betting on the country’s growing economy and banking sector for organic growth. Mexico is becoming increasingly important for HSBC and is now its fourth largest market in revenue terms, up from 16th in 2015 – a jump that is partly attributable to HSBC’s.divestiture from many smaller regional markets. “Mexico is a scale market, which is always really important,” Elek says. ""The economy is thriving as it comes out of the pandemic, the FX is performing strongly and we see a strong outlook for GDP growth driven by – among other things – marked increase in investment by our commercial partners due to the near-shoring phenomenon.”"

As part of the alliance, Bladex has become the first bank in Latin America to join the TradeAssets platform. Bladex and TradeAssets said they will collaborate to attract more Latin American banks to the platform. This will support flows through trade corridors connecting the region with Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, resulting in an attractive value proposal for Bladex’s stakeholders. “Bladex is building its strategic plan on a unique business model that will benefit from a series of critical alliances, such as the one with TradeAssets, which aims to grasp the existing finance opportunities across important trade corridors for Latin America in an efficient and safe manner,” said Bladex’s CEO, Jorge Salas. “We are enthusiastic about this strategic alliance as its value proposition meets several strategic goals for Bladex: it facilitates access to new markets; accelerates clients or counterparties growth and generates operational and efficiency improvements which contribute to adding technological strength. Additionally, it enables risk sharing and invites liquidity into Latin America.” TradeAssets will facilitate the establishment of relationships and efficient deal-making in new geographies. For example, thanks to the initiative Bladex is already engaged in conversations with several banks in India, where the LatAm-India corridor has huge importance, with total trade flows reaching US$43 billion in 2021"

Some of the threats to the financial industry included on the list are as follow:

The commoditisation of financial attacks: Kaspersky Lab expects to see the ‘commodification’ of attacks along the lines of the 2016 SWIFT heists in 2016 – with specialized resources being offered for sale in underground forums or through as-a-service schemes.
The compromise of payment systems: As payment systems become increasingly popular and common, Kaspersky Lab expects to see this matched by a greater criminal interest.
The rise of information warfare: In 2016, the world started to take seriously the dumping of hacked information for aggressive purposes. Such attacks are likely to increase in 2017, and there is a risk that attackers will try to exploit people’s willingness to accept such data as fact by manipulating or selectively disclosing information.
Alongside this, Kaspersky Lab expects to see a rise in vigilante hackers – hacking and dumping data, allegedly for the greater good.
Growing vulnerability to cyber-sabotage: As critical infrastructure and manufacturing systems remain connected to the Internet, often with little or no protection – the temptation to damage or disrupt them could prove overwhelming for cyber attackers, particularly those with advanced skills, and during times of rising geopolitical tension.
Espionage goes mobile: Kaspersky Lab expects to see more espionage campaigns targeted primarily at mobile, benefiting from the fact that the security industry can struggle to gain full access to mobile operating systems for forensic analysis.
Device integrity in an over-crowded Internet: As IoT-device manufacturers continue to pump out unsecured devices that cause wide-scale problems, there is a risk that vigilante hackers could take matters into their own hands and disable as many devices as possible.

Financial service firms that don't upgrade their business models for the digital era will go out of business, become commoditised or exist only formally without competing effectively, said the research and advisory company in its report Digitalization Will Make Most Heritage Financial Firms Irrelevant. It added that companies such as banks and insurance firms will struggle for relevance as global digital platforms, fintech companies and other non-traditional players gain greater market share, using technology to change the economics and business models of the industry.
Technology must transform, not just automate
Banks face a growing risk of failure if they continue to maintain 20th century business and operating models, according to Gartner analyst David Furlonger, speaking an event in Australia this week. He said: “Digital transformation is largely a myth as institutional mindsets, processes and structures stand firm. Established financial services providers will have to move faster on digital business by building digital platforms or finding niche products and services to sell on others’ platforms.”
Banks are underestimating the degree of change that digital technology will bring to their industry, according to Gartner's Pete Redshaw. He said: “The future of the financial services industry is increasingly weightless, requiring few physical assets to establish or maintain a presence. That makes the industry especially vulnerable to disruption by digital competitors.”
Too many financial services CEOs continue to see emerging technology as a means to optimise business through automation, rather than transform the business, according to Gartner’s 2018 CEO survey. Redshaw adds: “The biggest mistake financial services CIOs make is putting too much focus on technology. They should push their organizations for a more coherent response to digital business – it’s important to set the digital vision and destination first, then think about how to lead an organization there.”

Fintechs: Individual companies or pure-play/neobank subsidiaries will disaggregate traditional financial services in discrete product areas. They will participate in digital platforms, but will not own them. Less than 15 per cent of the winning group of traditional firms can convert themselves into or successfully spin off fintechs.
Long-tail firms: The dramatically lower costs enabled by digital platforms will allow some traditional providers to act as service brokers. This is likely for large populations of poor and working-class people around the world that were not profitable customers previously. Simultaneously, they can act as concierge providers of bundled offerings to high-net-worth individuals. Around 80 per cent of winning traditional financial services providers can become long-tail firms"

Establishing an excellent order-to-cash process is essential, according to the Accounts Receivable Automation white paper by OpusCapita, a B2B sales and payments service provider. The report acknowledges some of the pain-points of AR reconciliation, which include the complex, cumbersome invoice-to-cash process, which is often manual and slow, and the human task of sorting out exceptions in unmatched invoices. To ease some of these problems, OpusCapita suggests taking the following seven steps:

Enable close collaboration between sales and finance to determine payment terms that suit both your business and your customers.
Adopt clear policies for issuing credit to customers and a culture that ensures that the established policies are also followed in practice.
Digitalise AR-related processes and switch to electronic invoicing to speed up invoice delivery times.
Focus on your invoicing process to improve the quality and accuracy of your invoice information and to make sure your invoices are generated in a timely manner.
Demand more detailed payment information from your bank account statements – XML-based CAMT material supports the AR reconciliation process better than basic MT940 format.
Improve your ability to allocate incoming cash correctly and quickly, to be able to identify outstanding payments and take appropriate action to collect your receivables.
Complete the automation and finalize account statement processing with automated posting utilizing the information gathered in reconciliation"

Second, the geopolitical uncertainty created by the Russian-Ukraine conflict has resulted in global investors seeking safety in US currency and assets, as the US is seen as a source of economic growth and stability. And third, the US is more energy independent than European countries that import more of their oil and gas from abroad. In times of economic and political turmoil, investors tend to come into dollars, considered the primary safe-haven currency.

A strong dollar is weighing on earnings of US companies with large international operations. These American companies derive revenues from overseas and are suffering from the dollar’s strength when they convert foreign sales back into dollars. Coca Cola, Pepsi, Yum Brands, Procter & Gamble, AbbVie, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Philip Morris have been impacted by the surging dollar that will exert a drag on their profits and lower revenue forecasts. Technology titans such as IBM, Salesforce, Apple, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Netflix could be particularly hard hit since they generate the biggest portion of their sales outside of the US. Last week, IBM warned that the strengthening dollar could reduce its revenues this year by $3.5 billion, including about $900 million in the second quarter. Microsoft also trimmed its sales forecasts based on the rising and valuable dollar. Salesforce lowered its revenue guidance due to the surge in the dollar and expects to have a $600 million negative impact on revenues this year. Netflix blamed the dollar’s historic run-up against most other currencies for putting a serious dent in its revenue growth as it took a $339 million sales hit in Q2 (April-June) 2022. The outlook for the third quarter is even worse because Netflix says 60% of its revenue comes from international markets, but nearly all of its expenses are in dollars. The S&P 500 Foreign Revenue Exposure Index has dropped around 17% so far this year, compared with the broad S&P 500 index’s 13% decline. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 U.S. Revenue Exposure Index, which includes companies more dependent on domestic sales, has lost just 7%"

Imports or goods imported from countries whose currencies have dropped against the dollar have become cheaper. But for American companies that have big international footprints or sell products or services abroad, it is taking a toll. The strengthening of the dollar makes American manufactured products or exports more expensive overseas, which means foreign buyers need to pay more in local currency to purchase those goods. This deflates or lowers the value of international revenue generated by American multinational companies once it is converted into US dollars. The rising cost of US products can lead to a decline in demand and make American manufacturers less competitive, as overseas importers or foreign buyers look to alternative markets to source goods. These factors can hurt corporate America’s bottom line, especially businesses with global operations, as an 8–10% increase in the value of the dollar can lead to a 1% drop in US corporate profits, according to Credit Suisse. Disadvantaged US manufacturers may feel pressured to look for ways to cut costs to keep their prices competitive and maintain their margins. Furthermore, when exports become more expensive, it could mean expanding imports and declining exports add to the growing US trade deficit, leaving US policymakers with a conundrum – do they choose inflation or more trade deficit? If US multinational companies are concerned, then many foreign companies doing business in the US are benefitting from the mighty dollar, as their products are now cheaper to import into the country. Also, a rising dollar “inflates the value of U.S.-generated revenue on a foreign company's balance sheet once it's converted to a local currency,” as per a recent article published in Fortune. According to Fortune, on July 15, British luxury retailer “Burberry forecast that the strong dollar would boost its overall fiscal performance, increasing its full-year sales by almost $200 million. That cushioning is welcome news for Burberry; its sales in China—the source of a third of its sales—sunk by 35% this quarter due to the country's COVID lockdowns.”"

They now have more tools at their disposal to hedge foreign currency swings and risks and provide them visibility into what future overseas revenue may look like. The Wall Street Journal reported in late June that “Beverage maker Coca-Cola saw a roughly $200 million negative impact on its first-quarter operating income, which came in at $3.4 billion, up 25% compared with the prior-year period. The company has about $7.6 billion in notional foreign-exchange cash-flow hedges in place.” Corporate treasurers have been actively building foreign exchange hedge positions via forwards and options contracts, “as well as instruments like knock-ins and knock-outs, which allow companies to seek the protection of a hedge only at certain exchange rates,” the same article detailed in the Wall Street Journal"

Kotak added that the partnership with C2FO adds additional layers of depth to meet the increasing working capital needs of Indian businesses.
With US$2.2 trillion (Rupees 154 Lakh crore) of spend from Indian and global corporates represented by C2FO, and year-on-year growth of 300% in the adoption of C2FO by vendors to India’s corporates, Kotak expects the partnership to improve returns and margins for the bank’s customers, while creating an influx of liquidity for their vendors.
Early payment
Vendors of Kotak corporate customers can access early payment on approved invoices when they want, and at desired discount rates using C2FO, thus providing businesses with access to affordable capital. Using C2FO’s working capital market enables vendors to turn receivables into cash flow and corporates to turn payables into income.
“Partnering with C2FO allows us to offer an effective working capital management technology that provides corporates in India access to efficiency levels achieved by Fortune 500 companies globally,” said Shekhar Bhandari, senior EVP- global transaction banking and precious metals, Kotak Mahindra Bank.
Pradeep Gode, country head, C2FO India, added, “The C2FO and Kotak partnership further empowers collaboration between corporates and their vendors to improve working capital management for all.
“Kotak’s customers can now complement their existing working capital strategies with an innovative and risk-free solution that has proven to increase gross margin and EBITDA. Our customers have already experienced strong C2FO adoption from businesses across India, and we expect demand to grow as we open up this opportunity to Kotak’s customers.”"

""For those people who are running the investment management industry, they have to come out with their own responses to how their own organization plays this out, and which aspects they want to embrace and which ones they want to downplay. Doing nothing is not a solution,” believes Pollard.
This study shows how important CFA think they are, e.g. “The fundamental purpose of finance is to contribute to society through increases in societal wealth and well-being. Looking at finance as an ecosystem reveals important interconnections and points of friction in how finance currently works in relation to this purpose.” But their diagrams are superb, e.g. The Financial Ecosystem:

The study identifies four significant trends: 

Uncertainties brought about by geopolitical developments such as Brexit, Trump’s election, regulatory reform, etc.
Disruptions brought about by fast-paced developments in the financial technology (fintech) sector
The persistent low-yield environment and the resulting shift from passive to active management
Capitalism is evolving and investment needs to change too.

Investment industry focus needed 
In particular, CFA recommends that the industry focus on changes such as:

New skills for changed circumstances: recruit and develop talent along new dimensions and improve diversity. “The industry’s biggest challenge is finding leadership who can articulate a compelling vision for the institution and instil an ethical culture. Improving diversity is linked to better performance and culture,” Pollard says.
Fiduciary implementation: learning to balance fiduciary responsibility by putting the interests of clients first when determining investment strategy, limiting conflicts of interest and investing to the standard of care of a prudent expert – within the context of their own viability.
Restoring industry trust: emphasize strong values and show societal responsibility; communicate early, fully, and often, and to fill gaps in understanding.

Guidance letters from the FDIC carry similar instructions to those from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). In November, the guidance directed banks providing custody services and engaging in other crypto-related activities to seek approval from local OCC regulators. Both policies highlight the potential risks of cryptocurrencies, especially as banks increasingly move into digital assets. Todd Phillips, Director of Financial Regulation and Corporate Governance, Center for American Progress, stated that the regulatory agencies are not deterring banks from engaging in crypto. However, they would like advance notification so they understand the risks faced by banks and assess/evaluate whether their activities affect the bank’s safety and soundness. According to the agency’s guidance document, FDIC concerns fall into several areas related to cryptocurrency-related activities: security and soundness, financial stability and consumer protection. Furthermore, the agency’s document stated that cryptocurrency activities may add new, increased or unique credit, liquidity, market, pricing and operational risks that can raise security and soundness concerns. There are basic ownership issues, such as whether ownership can be clearly verified and confirmed. The FDIC has also identified the risk of financial stability and has serious concerns related to preventing money laundering and countering terrorist financing. The agency stated that crypto assets can pose a systemic risk due to the structure of cryptocurrencies or through the interoperability of certain digital assets. With regards to consumer protection, the FDIC stated that they are concerned about consumer misperception as to the role of a bank or “that a cryptocurrency is speculative when the customer interacts with a bank that typically offers more traditional banking products.” The agency further added that depository institutions could also have issues enforcing consumer protection requirements in activities related to cryptocurrencies"

The framework will also include new rules for crypto assets, including stablecoins backed with traditional assets. The UK government has also launched its own plans to make the UK a hub for digital finance. However, the FCA emphasized its position that standards must not be compromised and that consumer and market risk must be mitigated appropriately, further regulating crypto assets as the industry evolves. The Treasury stated that if a stablecoin is used for payments, it will be under the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies. The FCA commented that it would discuss how to regulate these tokens later this year. Additionally, the FCA supports innovative financial services as long as they have applications that are in the public interest. Stablecoins have traditionally been used primarily to buy other more volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but issuers have progressively used currencies as a tool for remittances and faster transfers. According to cryptocurrency data site CoinGecko, the rapid growth of the stablecoin market has grown from US $7 billion in value to about $190 billion over two years, which raises concern about its potential impact on monetary policy and financial stability. The Bank of England along with US regulators all warn that legislative and regulatory framework on adopting stablecoins for payments is urgently needed to mitigate these risks. The FCA, which currently has anti-money laundering regulation authority and is set to gain new power to monitor digital asset promotion, pledged to ensure that crypto companies comply with anti-money laundering regulations and will intervene if the company damages consumer or market integrity. Last week, the UK government announced that it would begin discussions on a broader regulatory framework for the digital asset market.

Subsequent to the Ukraine conflict starting on February 24, Russia suffered unprecedented western sanctions, blocking them from the global financial system and nearly half of its US$606.5 billion gold and foreign exchange reserves in early April. Anton Siluanov, Russian Finance Minister, stated that sanctions had significantly worsened global economic conditions, and that BRICS needed to expedite progress in the following areas: the use of national currencies for import and export operations, the integration of payment systems and cards, the establishment of their proprietary financial messaging system, and the creation of an independent BRICS rating organization. Russia established its own banking messaging system called SPFS, a SWIFT alternative, and its card payment system MIR started operation in 2015. Both financial tool developments were established to protect against potential consequences or penalties on Moscow. The Central Bank of Russia, in an unexpected move ahead of its regular board meeting scheduled for April 29, cut interest rates from 20% to 17% and maintains the prospect of further cuts at future meetings. Siluanov stated that these measures were taken to make the ruble’s exchange rate more foreseeable and less unstable. BRICS ministers confirmed the importance of working together to stabilize the current economic situation, stated the Finance Ministry. The report states that BRICS countries are reforming their financial interactions to prevent the economy from falling into crisis. They are also looking to create a BRICS-based interbank messaging system, similar to SWIFT, and other types of measures"

The CFO's remit now expands far beyond the management of corporate financial affairs and extends to looking for cost-savings throughout the organisation and evaluating the costs of investment in new markets.
The survey, of 300 middle market CFOs, conducted by Citizens Commercial Banking, found that 81 per cent of the CFOs surveyed said one of their key objectives in 2018 is to improve operational efficiencies, followed by expansion into new domestic markets and the development of new products, as shown below:

Within the context of lowering business costs, the survey found that CFOs are optimistic about how US tax policy changes could save companies money. A majority (60 per cent) said the anticipated federal tax policy changes would amplify company growth.
Payments efficiency
Electronic and real-time payments are important priorities for CFO although in the case of real-time payments, widespread implementation is likely to be delayed as companies wait for their peers to take the first step. Overall only 4 per cent of companies have implemented a real-time payments system and 38 per cent have researched the topic and have plans to implement in future.
CFOs are also increasingly using e-payments in their companies to drive greater business efficiencies, reduce costs and improve working capital – the survey report says that CFOs “seek an increase of 17 per cent in payables and 15 per cent in receivables executed electronically”.

Focus on core finance
The survey shows that middle market company CFOs will be focusing more in future on keeping the company properly financed, cash management, international expansion and investor relationships. Since cybersecurity and fraud continue to be among the biggest business risks, while compliance is also an ongoing issue, it's surprising that CFOs said they will be focusing less in future on fraud prevention and monitoring, and less on corporate governance"

    •    In January 2018 the UK payments results: GROWING: direct debit (4%). CHAPS (8%); Faster Payments Service - Single immediate payments (23%). Forward dated payment (11%); DECLINING: Cheques (15%)
Tips on payment collections:
    •    From Stripe - the payment processor - ensure your systems:
    ⁃    block invalid expiry dates
    ⁃    validate credit cards in real time including showing the image of card scheme to reassure cardholder they are inputting the correct details
    ⁃    enable auto-fill (held in the cardholder’s browser) correctly
    ⁃    provide mobile checkout: provide numerical pad to facilitate data entry, conversion rates can double if you get it right, e.g. the 150,000 Shopify businesses who switched on Apple Pay last year
Tips on making payments:
    •    From Previse (who use Artificial Intelligence to enable corporate buyers to safely ensure they can pay all their suppliers instantly):
    ⁃    pay your suppliers on time (Wax Digital research showed that 69% of companies in UK admit to being frequent late payers; other research shows that 27 per cent of invoices are paid late in the UK) because it puts your suppliers at risk and increases their charges to buyers
    ⁃    Provide early payment facilities for those suppliers that need them, the earlier the better, I.e. Funding from receipt of invoice or even from issuance of PO is much better for your suppliers than funding from invoice approval"

The network’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, met Bank of England governor Mark Carney last month to discuss the opportunities and risks involved in launching a cryptocurrency and is expected to flesh out its plans in more detail later this summer. Facebook has also consulted officials at the US Treasury for their advice on operational and regulatory issues.
The group is also said to in talks with money transfer firms including Western Union for ways of enabling people without a bank account to send and receive money faster and more cheaply, which would be facilitated by its own digital currency.
Gestating plans

The plans for Project Libra were first reported last December and will see Facebook collaborate with banks and brokers on methods for people to change dollars and other international currencies into its digital coins. The group is also believed to be in talks with online merchants, with the proposal that they accept the cryptocurrency in return for lower transaction fees.
Facebook has faced criticism over its handling of users’ personal data, and regulators are likely to scrutinise the proposed launch closely.

Paul Travers from Oakvale Treasury wrote 'From an Australian perspective, I am glad to see Aud Libor go, as for the past couple of years it has been set well above the local benchmark, BBSW (Bank Bill Swap Rate), and cause issues with some of our clients who are subsidaries of European companies. They would receive a valuation for an AUD derivative (and rate set against BBSW) from their parent company based on a curve constructed using A$LIBOR. This valuation was very different to the valuation they would receive from their local valuation advisor and the bank.'
The alternatives to LIBOR are described in the ACT's excellent briefing note. But Michelle Price from ACT stressed that: 'Whilst alternatives to LIBOR could be ""widely used locally published rates"" each user should perform the necessary due diligence to determine the most relevant benchmark rate that matches their requirements.'
 

At least the confusion between head office and the subsidiaries will be reduced by the removal of LIBOR in these markets. But, sadly, the manipulative bankers will still remain"

Part of ION Bank Account Management (IBAM), the solution is meant to address a growing need to better manage costs within the treasury organisation. It is part of a new set of offerings created by ION Treasury for its community of over 50,000 users around the world.
The company says that corporations spend tens of billions of dollars per year on transaction banking services, yet billing statements are non-standard, requiring manual analysis to review the data and associated fees.
A poll conducted earlier this year by consulting firm Strategic Treasurer found that 57% of responders listed these manual processes as a top operational challenge. An additional 30% listed bank account management as the operation they could not consistently perform, due to lack of time, multiple systems and formats, and other technological constraints.
Available with all ION Treasury solutions, Bank Fee Analysis validates the accuracy of billed versus contracted fees, identifies and reconciles errors automatically, and ensures compliance against negotiated contracts in an easy to navigate dashboard.
“As we partner with our customers, we see a continual concern with the manual effort associated with reconciling bank fees,” said ION Treasury CEO Rich Grossi. “Bank Fee Analysis provides powerful reporting and decision-making tools to help users drive down cost, negotiate better contracts and terms, and identify the best banks for their business.”"

BSB is a message standard providing billing statements of bank charges to their wholesale clients. BSB is supported by a increasing number of banks as providers, and used by a growing number of corporates to account for and evaluate bank fees.  
Three related surveys have been developed to capture the capabilities and intersects of three separate groups: banks, corporates and financial application providers. 
New BSB surveys
Participants in previous surveys have come from all over the globe. TWIST invite you to participate in this new study before it closes  on May 15th. Completing the survey should take approximately fifteen minutes.
The new surveys are available for:

corporates – click link here - where you will be asked to register to receive an email with links to the survey.
banks - click here for document - which contains instructions for submission of the completed survey at the end of the survey document
financial application providers - click here for document - which also contains instructions for submission of the completed survey.

Just to put this in context, the GDP of the United States last year was $18.46 trillion (Bureau of Economic Analysis data). The two biggest companies saw their market cap increase in the past year: Apple passed the $800 billion mark in May while Alphabet's market cap stands at $676 billion. Together they account for 8.5 per cent of the total market cap in the world's 100 biggest companies.
US companies account for almost 70 per cent of the growth in the top 100 ranking and account for just over half (55) of the top 100 companies. Overall, US companies have 63 per cent of the market capitalisation. The strongest performing companies were Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. Only 22 of the top 100 companies are European, accounting for only 17 per cent of the overall market capitalisation. China and Hong Kong have 11 companies in the top 100.
PwC's Clifford Tompsett said: “The gap between the US largest companies and the rest of the world continues to widen. US companies are exploiting their global reach, financial strength and ability to innovate, a sharp contrast to those in the UK and Europe, which continue to fall behind in the rankings.”
These are some of the key findings in PwC's research:

the US dominates, as all companies in the Top 10 are US companies;
Europe has 22 companies in the top 100 and the UK has five (the latter down from seven companies last year);
two Chinese companies, Tencent and Alibaba, are at number 11 and 12, having raised their ranking significantly in 2017;
Apple retains the pole position for the sixth year in a row, with the gap with Alphabet (ex-Google) more than doubling in the past year;
the technology sector overtook the financial sector last year and has retained the lead, closely followed by financials.

Volatility 'normal' for new currency
'Bitcoin is getting demolished', said the headline on Business Insider earlier this week, on news that the cryptocurrency has lost 17 per cent of its value since the start of the year. But don't forget that Bitcoin was actually the world's best-performing currency in 2016 – and in 2015. What caused the recent fall was news that China is investigating Bitcoin exchanges in Beijing and Shanghai, which are suspected of market manipulation and money laundering. To add balance, Bitcoin was also the worst performing currency in 2014, pointing to the currency's ongoing rollercoaster ride.
This kind of volatility sounds deeply unappealing to risk-averse financial professionals but it's interesting that some payments experts are reminding us that, despite the negative headlines, there is much potential in cryptocurrencies. Nick Spanos, the founder of the Bitcoin Center NYC, pointed out that Bitcoin is still very much in its infancy and what we are currently seeing are the initial developments: “It’s like we just invented the wheel and soon we’re going to have the train, the motor car, the airplane - we're going to have all these things come about through Bitcoin and the block chain.”
Bitcoin myths
And ACI Worldwide's Christopher Taine writes that “this kind of volatility is normal for a new currency”. Taine goes on to 'bust some Bitcoin myths', which include:

Bitcoin is illegal: Taine writes: “Today, criminal activity is mainly conducted in legal tender and according to Europol, organized crime earns around 1.5 billion EUR per year from payment card fraud. The FBI has said that criminals can't hide behind bitcoin because investigators can follow the money by tracking financial data publicly.”
Bitcoin is insecure: In fact, Bitcoin account holders are highly protected.
Bitcoin is not compliant: Taine argues this is not the case and that, in future, market players are going to be divided into those that are AML-compliant and those that are not.

Bitcoin ETF could boost confidence
While its volatility makes Bitcoin unsuitable for use in the mainstream corporate world, it does have real-world advantages. For example, it doesn't rely on the mainstream global financial payment systems, so Bitcoin can be sent to any recipient in any country – and contrary to some of the myths, it is traceable. If the currency stabilises, the advantages of using cryptocurrencies could become more attractive. In addition, by 11 March the Securities and Exchange Commission is due to announce whether or not it will approve a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposed by the Winklevoss brothers. If the SEC gives the Bitcoin ETF the green light, this could bolster confidence in the currency"

New thinking is needed. Could war game simulations help companies prepare for and respond to crime more effectively?
PwC has published a paper examining how the financial services industry (including both banking, capital markets and insurance) responds to economic crime. It points out that, despite huge investment in compliance, almost half of the financial service companies in PwC's economic crime survey have had experience of economic crime in the previous 24 months. The survey showed that 46 per cent of financial services firms had reported an economic crime in the past two years, compared to an average of 36 per cent of companies in other industries. This is despite the fact that financial service entities are investing more in combatting crime than other types of company.
The cost of financial crime
Some of PwC's economic crime survey results include:

almost a quarter (24 per cent) of the survey respondents said that the economic crime cost them from $100,000 - $1m;
16 per cent of those that reported experiencing economic crime had suffered more than 100 incidents, with 6 per cent suffering more than 1,000;
cybercrime reports increased 10 per cent (49 per cent experienced), and insider trading increased by 6 percentage points (from 4 per cent to 10 per cent);
53 per cent of respondents reported that spending on fighting economic crime was increasing – 55 per cent expect it will continue to increase;
33 per cent of the respondents revealed that data quality still can restrict compliance with anti-money laundering regulations; and
35 per cent of respondents thought financial crime had high or medium impact on relationships with regulators.

AML skills shortage and insider crime
Some of the challenges facing the financial service industry include a global shortage of qualified and experienced compliance personnel with expertise in AML and counter-terrorist financing, as well as the problem of economic crime perpetrated by company employees. Insiders were responsible for financial crimes in 29 per cent of cases within the financial services industry.
""New thinking is needed to make investment in compliance deliver value and to tackle economic crime more effectively,” said Andrew Clark, PwC's EMEA financial crime leader.
A new approach?

""New thinking is needed to make investment in compliance deliver value and to tackle economic crime more effectively,” said Andrew Clark, PwC's EMEA financial crime leader.
A new approach?
An approach discussed by Chuck Saia, of Deloitte, in Compliance Week involves the idea of using gaming simulation techniques in scenario planning. He describes a “war game” simulation that reveals the challenges organisations face before, during, and after a cyber-incident: “Participants are faced with many business-impacting decisions, including whom to report to and when, cyber-insurance issues, regulatory challenges, third-party vendor relationships, and brand and reputation management. It’s a tense and uncomfortable experience. Even when you know it’s a simulation, your heart sinks when your organisation’s reputation is in danger.”
Simulate a cyber attack
Saia suggests that such simulations can help companies to see gaps and weaknesses in their crime prevention and response strategies. He concludes that it allows them to 'practice' their response procedures and strengthen preventive strategies: “A war game simulation is one way to test your ability to survive and even thrive in a crisis.”

CTMfile take: It sounds a little far-fetched, but with data to suggest that compliance simply isn't helping companies to defend themselves from economic crime, then trying a war game simulation as part of the corporate scenario planning could well open up executive eyes to gaps and weaknesses in the corporate's crime prevention and response strategies"

US banks now account for four of the seven dealers in the list of 2019 Greenwich Share Leaders in Overall European Fixed Income.
At the top of that list is J.P. Morgan, which ranks a clear first in market share. Citi is second, followed by Barclays, Goldman Sachs, and then the trio of HSBC, BNP Paribas and BofA Securities, which are statistically tied in fifth place.
US banks also top the list of 2019 Greenwich Quality Leaders. J.P. Morgan is the 2019 Greenwich Quality Leader in Overall European Fixed-Income Service Quality as well as in Research and is joined by Citi as a Greenwich Quality Leader in Sales and Trading.
Market leaders in fixed income share several interrelated attributes - strong balance sheet, scale and the ability to invest in and deploy supporting technology. As e-trading and digital tools become a bigger part of the marketplace, European fixed income is increasingly becoming a scale business.
“In this new environment, banks with the biggest and most sophisticated global technology platforms have a significant advantage,” says Greenwich Associates principal, Satnam Sohal.
Tech advantage
E-trading grew to 45% of overall European fixed-income trading volume in 2019 from 38% in 2018. Well over half of corporate bond volume and more than 60% of government bond trading volume is now priced and executed via electronic platforms. Over the past 12 months, growth was driven by rates, both G10 and emerging markets, across both cash and derivatives. Dealers that have historically invested in infrastructure to support quoting on multidealer platforms are making strategic investments to support evolving investor behaviours, including: 

Auto-pricing. Automated pricing of corporate and government bonds is now a requirement to be a top player. As e-trading has grown, so too has the number of inbound requests for quotes dealers must respond to on any given day. It has become impossible for a human trader to respond accurately and quickly enough to remain competitive. As such, auto-execution of such trades has become the norm, and Greenwich Associates expects continuous, streaming prices to grow in Europe as they have begun to do in the US.

Portfolio trading. The growing importance of fixed-income ETFs has catalysed increased interest in portfolio trading of corporate bonds. Portfolio trading isn’t for everyone, but it will certainly play a part in growing market share going forward.
Streaming. Though still nascent, dealers are beginning to offer select clients direct streaming prices in fixed income via APIs. Both order management system (OMS) and execution management system (EMS) technology make it possible for investors to aggregate dealer streams and mimic the multidealer liquidity offered by existing multidealer platforms - common practice in the FX markets. As bid-offer spreads in fixed income narrow, there is increasing economic incentive for dealers to provide direct liquidity to clients without intermediation of the platforms and incurring platform fees. It is still early, but the report suggests that this trend is likely to grow"

This translated to an additional A$5.5 billion (US$4bn) in cash being locked up in company working capital cycles and Australian companies holding back on payments to suppliers as they attempted to protect their own cashflow. The year ahead is expected to present further challenges. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that unemployment rose to 5.2% as the economy shed more than 46,000 jobs; a worse-than-anticipated figure. Like many other countries, Australia is feeling the impact of delays in international supply chains that have created a “perfect storm” for retailers and manufacturers. The impact of the pandemic is also persisting, with Australia now easing its tough border restrictions – which has kept the number of Covid cases and related deaths relatively low since March 2020"

McGrathNicol Advisory partner Jason Ireland told the Australian Financial Review that he expects Australia’s economic recovery to be led by businesses with efficient working capital cycles. A shorter working capital cycle in which the company collects cash faster from customers while holding an optimal level of inventory enables capital to be deployed faster to drive growth or navigate a crisis. Companies with a shorter working capital cycle are better placed to pay suppliers faster, which has a positive impact on the rest of the economy. The 2021 Working Capital Report found sharp variations in company performance, with the difference between the best and worst performers being greater than 100 days in five of the seven sectors, and greater than 200 days in three of those sectors: agriculture, retail and food/beverages. Ireland also told AFR that he hopes companies will use the months ahead to improve their performance, warning that working capital hold ups will hamper businesses in 2022. “Our research shows that a material competitive advantage can be achieved by implementing best practice,” he commented. “The companies that have improved their working capital processes will thrive. The best way you have more cash in your working capital cycle is to collect payments faster from your customers, and that will have a positive impact on your inventory and companies in your supply chain.” His colleague, McGrathNicol partner Sean Wiles, added that 2022 will present opportunities for growth for Australian firms in all sectors but how teams manage their working capital will determine how well they capture that opportunity. “The businesses that are ahead of the working capital cycle and managing their cash flow are best placed to pull the broader economy back from the brink,” he added. Ireland recommends establishing a strong process for collecting payments, based on strong customer engagement to ensure the company fulfils their expectations, a clear contract, and good processes to track compliance. “Best practice processes for billing and managing cashflow will mean there is more cash flowing through a business. This in turn leads to better inventory management and will help other companies down the supply chain.”"

Johannesburg-based Standard Bank, which operates in 20 countries across Africa, will leverage AWS services, including data analytics and machine learning, to automate financial operations and enhance customer facing web and mobile applications.
The announcement comes two weeks after the bank said that it would close 91 branches, with the majority of closures taking place by June, and cut 1,200 jobs as it digitised its retail and business operations. However, Standard Bank Namibia subsequently stated that it has no plans to close down branches or reduce staff numbers.
New business initiatives
The migration to AWS will take place across all Standard’s business units including corporate investment banking, subject to approvals from local regulators. As part of the move, an AWS cloud centre of excellence will be established within the bank, with a dedicated team facilitating migration to the cloud and developing AWS training and certification programmes for employees.
Standard Bank also plans to take advantage of various ancillary AWS services, including Amazon SageMaker, to advance fraud detection and launch new business initiatives, such as machine learning-based advisor capabilities to help customers make more informed financial decisions.
The bank will collaborate with AWS in building an education and digital skills programme, to be launched across Southern Africa, to train the next generation of African cloud experts.
“For Standard Bank Group to remain a leader in African financial services, we recognize we need to adopt a cloud-first approach to our business,” said Sim Tshabalala, group CEO of Standard Bank
“AWS cloud technology will create a springboard, helping us to rapidly roll out our digitisation and data strategy to better cater to customers whose needs are constantly evolving.”"

7651,3302,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/what-are-the-donts-of-fx-risk-management,The 5 ‘don’ts’ of FX risk management,2017-03-20,,"Managing foreign currency risk is one of the top challenges for corporate treasurers at multinational organisations but what are some of the mistakes companies often make in FX hedging?
Hedging currency risk is a nuanced, complex task and just one of the many responsibilities vying for the treasurer's time and attention. It can take months to put a currency hedge in place and in the current climate, with political surprises increasing moves in foreign exchange rates, treasurers need to stay on their toes when it comes to mitigating currency exposures.
In the past 12 months, we've seen major volatility among the world's main currencies. The pound declined following the UK's 'Brexit' vote, the euro is moving towards parity with the US dollar, China's renminbi is weakening and the the Mexican peso took a dive after the Trump presidential victory. Further volatility is expected in 2017, with further elections in Europe, Brexit negotiations and uncertainty about the US's trade relationships with Mexico and China in particular. The only thing that's clear is that now is the time to make sure your FX risk management is top class. So what are some of the mistakes companies often make in FX hedging? Here are some suggestions of the pitfalls to avoid.
1. Don't try to second-guess the news
We know when to expect certain news events but when it comes to election results, interest rate hikes or the impact of political announcements (or tweets), predicting the impact on FX is far more difficult. The market can react to unexpected news in unexpected ways, as we have seen repeatedly over the past year. It can therefore be dangerous to take a position before a news announcement and it's far better to take a longer-term strategy (as described in this CTMfile article). 
2. Don't pay too much
Always make sure you have information on a range of rates and fees so you don't get 'stuck in a rut' of paying a small group of relationship bankers. It's always worth shopping around if time allows. Hedging internally will also decrease FX hedging fees further and it's even better to look for the natural hedge in your company's operations and seek to mitigate risk that way.
3. Don't misinterpret your global balance sheet data
Cash flow forecasting is a challenge for companies with a global footprint and decentralised operations"

Hedging internally will also decrease FX hedging fees further and it's even better to look for the natural hedge in your company's operations and seek to mitigate risk that way.
3. Don't misinterpret your global balance sheet data
Cash flow forecasting is a challenge for companies with a global footprint and decentralised operations. If you don't have clear data on your global cash positions, you won't have visibility of your actual FX exposures, making it impossible to hedge accurately. Paying close attention to the data your financial officers around the world are providing, whether it's account or balance sheet, will give a clearer picture of the risks you're exposed to.
4. Don't rely on quarterly reporting
Try to analyse FX data as often as possible, not just once a quarter or even annually, as is the case for some companies. Staying up-to-date with the fluctuations in your own company's exposures and currency requirements will help to hedge where and when needed.
5. Don't forget the transactions
Companies need to be able to measure their FX exposures overall but, more than that, they need to hedge individual transactions – focusing on this can provide a more realistic picture of your hedging requirements, rather than trying to guess the direction of currency markets"

He also revealed that SIA currently has €500 million available for two acquisitions in Europe, for which it has been short-listed. Listing the company in Milan would allow SIA to raise around €1 billion in new funds for more acquisitions, said Cordone.
“All our shareholders agree that we need to grow in Europe and they are also considering an IPO,” the CEO told Reuters, adding that they would probably decide by this summer. He confirmed that the company could be valued at not less than €3.5 billion based on an EBITDA of over €200 million at the end of last year.
Europe’s electronic payments market generated revenues of more than €80 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow by 3-5% a year in terms of transactions by 2021, according to McKinsey data cited in a press presentation of SIA’s new plan.
No tie-up with Nexi
SIA is 49.5% owned by Italy’s state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) through investment vehicle FSIA Investimenti. Italian infrastructure fund F2i, in which CDP has 14%, has 17% in SIA. Other shareholders include Italian lenders Banco BPM, Intesa Sanpaolo, Unicredit and Mediolanum and Deutsche Bank.
Cordone said SIA’s board does not envisage a potential tie-up with Italian digital payment specialist Nexi but did not rule out the possibility that SIA shareholders considering closer cooperation in the future. Nexi recently approved the launch of its own IPO process, with a possible valuation of more than €7 billion.

All the indicators are pointing to downside numbers,” WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters in an interview. “The indicators are not looking good. A global recession – that is what I think we are edging into.” Any downgrade of the WTO’s trade growth projections for 2022 would be a second revision, following an announcement last April that it had lowered its projection for growth in merchandise trade this year to 3%, down from 4.7% previously. It has also pencilled in growth of 3.4% for 2023. The decrease in growth projection comes after the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) this week cut its growth forecasts for the Group of 20 economies next year. The global economy will expand just 2.2% in 2023, the OECD said on Monday, against its earlier forecast in June of 2.8%. The new projection for the year means output will be US$2.8 trillion less than officials had predicted at the end of 2021. Indonesia is the only G20 that the OECD believes has slightly better prospects next year than it previously predicted. The WTO’s revised forecast for trade growth is expected next month. Okonjo-Iweala says she is mostly concerned with food supply and energy access issues, noting that they have been affected by Russia's invasion of.Ukraine. “I am very concerned about food security. The spectre of not having enough food is one that worries me. Access to energy is creating problems at the moment.” International concern over food supplies has grown since the invasion of Ukraine in February with some analysts comparing the impending food shortage to something similar, or worse than, that of the crisis faced in 2007-08. As the global food system has already taken a hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic, analysts say the war has exacerbated the global food crisis"

As the global food system has already taken a hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic, analysts say the war has exacerbated the global food crisis. Russia and Ukraine together export nearly 12% of food calories that are traded globally, being major providers of basic agro-commodities such as maize, sunflower oil, and wheat. Russia is also the world’s top exporter of fertilisers. Several regions are heavily dependent for their basic food supply on imports from these two countries, which normally over 50% of cereal imports in the Middle East and North Africa combined.

The BoE that it would buy as many long-dated government bonds as needed between now and 14 October in a bid to stabilise financial markets in the wake of the mayhem that followed the government's mini-budget announced on 23 September. In addition to the plunge in the value of the pound in the past week, it has also seen investors demand a greater rate of return for UK government bonds - essentially IOUs. That is because the level of borrowing required to fund the government giveaway, including tax cuts and energy aid for households and businesses, shocked the market which immediately questioned the sustainability of the public finances. The intervention is reported to have cost the Bank as much as £65 billion (US$70 billion). The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has since added its voice to criticisms of the government’s “dash for growth” under the UK’s new prime minister, Liz Truss. What the Bank's action is aimed at doing is tackling consequences of rising bond yields, in this instance a liquidity crunch facing pension funds. The move, aimed at ""restoring orderly market conditions”, had an immediate impact on the rates demanded by investors to hold UK government debt. The pound fell back in response but bond yields did ease back from multi-year highs. On Thursday morning both sterling and the euro both fell in early trading and the US dollar recouped a recent dip as relief at the BoE’s intervention in bond markets faded. The Bank’s former governor, Mark Carney accused Liz Truss’ government of “undercutting” the country’s economic institutions and working at “cross purposes” with the BoE. Truss and her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, appeared to be working at “cross purposes” with the Bank, he suggested"

The Banque de France announced new projects to achieve the benefits of CBDCs used at a wholesale level by banks and financial markets. “A wholesale CBDC could significantly contribute to improving cross-border and cross-currency payments,” Villeroy de Galhau, a governor at the Bank of France, said when he appeared at the bank’s digital currency conference. CBDCs at the wholesale level attract less attention than their headline-grabbing retail equivalent, he added. One venture will look to improve CBDCs’ liquidity management in decentralised finance (DeFi) – such as via automated market makers – which would play a role equivalent to that of investment banks that seek to sustain trading in a particular security, de Galhau said. Another project will focus on issuing and distributing tokenised bonds on a blockchain, he said, building on previous findings about CBDCs being used to settle Web3 securities, such as the French central bank’s Project Jura, which has explored the settlement of tokenised euro commercial paper and foreign exchange transactions. Further details will be detailed in the coming weeks, he added. The European Central Bank (ECB) is considering whether to issue a digital euro as soon as 2026, de Galhau said. The ECB is one of many central banks exploring the possibility of a CBDC for everyday use and for financial markets"

Speaking earlier this week at a conference in Singapore, Adani said that “increasing nationalism, supply chain risk mitigation, and technology restrictions,” as well as resistance to Beijing’s huge Belt and Road (BRI) initiative, would impact China’s global role. Adani was speaking weeks after the business mogul became the world’s third richest man, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is the first Asian to take that spot. The founder of the eponymous Adani Group controls companies ranging from ports to power. He said that “housing and credit risks” in the world’s second largest economy were also “drawing comparisons with what happened to the Japanese economy during the ‘lost decade’ of the 1990s.” While pessimistic about China, Adani remains bullish about his own country, saying that India is “one of the few relatively bright spots from a political, geostrategic, and market perspective.” He anticipates India to become the world’s third largest economy by 2030, with “the largest consuming middle class the world will ever see.” Several technology firms looking to reduce their dependence on Chinese manufacturing already see India as an attractive alternative. This week Apple confirmed that it has started manufacturing its new iPhone 14 in India, as the technology giant looks to diversify its supply chain. While the company manufactures the bulk of its products in China, it has decided to start producing its latest devices in India much earlier than with previous generations. Businesses may have to move away from China not just because of its strict anti-Covid restrictions, which have squeezed supply chains in recent months, but also because of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over Taiwan. The US government recently ordered two of the country’s top chipmakers to stop selling high-performance chips to China, while last week, leaders of America’s biggest banks said they could exit China if it ever attacks Taiwan. Adani also mentioned the challenges facing the United Kingdom and countries in the European Union, because of the war in Ukraine and Brexit. “While I expect all these economies will readjust over time — and bounce back — the friction of the bounce-back looks far harder this time,” he said"

The Court set aside a lower court’s earlier award of summary judgement in favour of the bank. The case is one of several slowly progressing through the courts, particularly in the Asian trading hub of Singapore that were triggered by a series of financial failures among commodities traders over the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this case, Standard Chartered claims that Maersk mis-delivered a cargo of gasoil from Winson Oil to Hin Leong in late February 2020 without the original bills of lading. The bank had paid Winson US$6.1 million under a letter of credit (LC) applied for by Hin Leong. Hin Leong, which had a broader trade finance facility in place with Standard Chartered, did not repay the amount and the trader collapsed shortly after the delivery. The trader’s founder has since faced charges of widespread fraud although allegations of wrongdoing have not been made against it by the parties in this case. After finally receiving the bills of lading from Winson in mid-2020, Standard Chartered demanded that Maersk pay the sum to it owed by Hin Leong. While the lower court previously ruled that Maersk has no reasonable prospect of mounting a defence against Standard Chartered’s claim at trial, the High Court judge sided with the shipping company, finding that there are severable “triable” issues relating to Standard Chartered’s financing of the specific oil cargo at the heart of the dispute and the broader financing facility. According to the judgement, Maersk argued that “there are various indicia which point towards the plaintiff never having regarded the bills of lading as security for the financing granted to Hin Leong”. “This meant that the effective or proximate cause of the plaintiff’s loss was not the mis-delivery by the defendant [Maersk] of the gasoil cargo to Hin Leong without presentation of the bills of lading. Instead, it was the insolvency of Hin Leong and the way in which the plaintiff’s [Standard Chartered] financing arrangements were structured,” the judgement summarises the shipping company as saying"

The warning came as fashion retail chain Next, a bellwether of the UK high street and one of its most consistently successful performers, warned that downward pressure on the pound since the government’s tax-cutting mini-budget of 23 September could prolong cost of living pressures. The retailer said that as most clothing and homeware factories price their goods in US dollars, it meant that costs were likely to continue rising next year. Next also cut its profit and sales targets for 2022, predicting shoppers would cut back on purchases as prices rose. The group now expects profits of about £840 million (US$912 million) this year, against a previous forecast of £860 million. Next reported that trading in August had been ""below our expectations"" and that the pressure on shoppers was likely to rise in the coming months, ahead of the key Christmas period. It added that prices for its autumn and winter ranges were already up by an average of 8% this year compared with 2021, as it has had to pass on extra costs to customers. Next also expects to see similar rates of inflation for its spring and summer ranges next year.UK prices in August were 9.9% higher than they were 12 months ago. The group said, however, it has seen some cost pressures, such as freight and logistics, ease in recent months"

The monitoring tools mandated by the BCBS require banks to assemble the necessary data to ensure effective monitoring of banks’ intra-day liquidity risk, and their ability to meet payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis in normal and stressed conditions. The BCBS would like banks to start using the monitoring tools for reporting in January 2015, with full implementation by January 2017. Actual implementation depends upon the regulatory mandate at the national level.Intra-day position required for each account, but ….BCBS reporting requirements present a real data challenge to financial institutions. The demands for data on liquidity flows, rather than balance sheets, will require significant changes to banks’ existing data models and processes. The BCBS monitoring tools require a retrospective view of aggregated data points using credit/debit confirmations from servicing institutions and Payments Settlement Systems. Based on analysis of SWIFT data, only 20% of total correspondent banking payment instructions on SWIFT are confirmed with a credit/debit confirmation message. The share in value is higher reaching 55% and has increased by 4% over last year.“To achieve the level of detail required by the retrospective BCBS measures, banks will need to build the intra-day position for each of their accounts with real-time credit/debit confirmations, says Catherine Banneux, Senior Market Manager, Banking, at SWIFT. “This is a critical component of the monitoring requirements that will differ according to a bank’s size and profile. Progress needs to accelerate in order for banks to be ready for BCBS reporting"

Progress needs to accelerate in order for banks to be ready for BCBS reporting.”SWIFT’s suggestionsGiven the short implementation timeframe and the strain on IT and business resources in many institutions, the SWIFT paper suggests practical ways of supporting banks to better prepare for the BCBS reporting requirements for intra-day liquidity, including: banks should start preparing by leveraging the infrastructure and data formats they already have in place to feed their central intra-day liquidity transaction database banks should first assess their current reporting coverage, which will help the banks determine current gaps and the next steps to close them data centralisation must be addressed and could be easily managed vis-à-vis a messaging copy mechanism that enables the group liquidity or treasury service to obtain the missing flows as the reporting will need to be done at both a global and local entity level, data aggregation will require the mapping between the legal entity identifier (LEI) and the bank’s related operational codes.In conclusion, SWIFT believes that industry practices will inevitably have to change, leading the way towards a more collaborative and standardised approach to address intra-day liquidity management challenges. They add, rather hopefully, “Through industry standards and best practices, the banking community is well placed to collaboratively stimulate cost effective and sustainable business models in support of new requirements around intra-day liquidity.”Impact on corporatesWhen the banks have the precise knowledge of their intra-day liquidity position and the impact of any corporate payments and receipts, they will able react to change accordingly. Either by introducing intra-day liquidity charges and/or giving windows in which to make and receive payments. These practices have already begun, but in 2017 life will become even more complicated for corporate treasury departments"

Measures being introduced by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) will require banks and insurance companies to validate trade transaction and documents to combat the risk of fraud.
China Daily cites reports from Beijing media group Caixin Media, which suggest that banks will be required to obtain primary, original documentation from the corporate borrower and its trading partner to stronger finance underwriting.
The CBIRC also wants banks to extend its risk assessment beyond the corporate buyer and supplier to include other organisations along their supply chains.
Recent cases
The reports come as the fallout continues from alleged fraud in a case involving e-commerce conglomerates Suning.com and JD.com.
According to Caixin Media, Chinese wealth and asset management firm Noah Holdings has warned that US$490 million worth of asset management products, backed by conglomerate Camsing Global’s accounts receivable from JD.com, are now at risk of default. A similar dispute involves accounts receivable from Suning.
An unnamed source close to Noah told reporters that the alarm was raised after Camsing made changes to its account and requested an increase in financing. Noah then notified the police of suspicious activity and some Camsing Global executives have been detained by the authorities.
JD.com claims to have no knowledge of the issue and is now accusing Camsing Global of providing false accounts receivable documents to obtain the financing. JD.com also suggests Noah is at fault for failing to mitigate risk and implement controls that would have verified documentation that supposedly shows Camsing’s accounts receivable from JD.com. Noah, however, claims that it had verified all documentation with JD.com.
Suning has similarly denied involvement after asset manager and financial services group Yunnan International Trust reported its suspicions to police over asset management products issued to Camsing backed by Suning accounts payable; Suning also accuses Camsing of falsifying its trade documents.
Regulators respond
Chinese regulators appear to have decided that the disputes expose a need for more stringent trade document verification among banks and other providers of  trade finance products"

Suning has similarly denied involvement after asset manager and financial services group Yunnan International Trust reported its suspicions to police over asset management products issued to Camsing backed by Suning accounts payable; Suning also accuses Camsing of falsifying its trade documents.
Regulators respond
Chinese regulators appear to have decided that the disputes expose a need for more stringent trade document verification among banks and other providers of  trade finance products.
“How to prevent operational risk, such as collusion between financial officers of a core company with other businesses in the upstream and downstream of a supply chain to commit loan fraud, is a major problem to be solved by banks providing supply chain finance solutions,” said the National Institution for Finance and Development’s (NIFD) deputy director Zeng Gang told China Daily.
“Banks should repeatedly verify whether or not a transaction is real by improving business process management and reducing manual operational risk to the greatest extent with the use of financial technologies.”
The regulator has also encouraged financiers and insurance firms to adopt technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain to strengthen their document verification processes and create greater transparency within supply chains to combat fraud.
Zeng added that financial institutions must be proactive in their underwriting and risk mitigation efforts to promote the availability of SCF without opening the door to fraud. Technology, he said, is key to these efforts.
“As the risk of SCF relies heavily on the business conditions of core companies, banks should also strengthen forward-thinking research of a particular industry,” he said.
“Based on the results of studies, banks could set an upper limit on the line of credit and make decisions on when to develop SCF, when to contain the business, and when to withdraw from it.”"
7669,3307,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/searching-for-standardisation-in-kyc,Searching for standardisation in KYC,2020-08-11,,"As the global requirements for customer due diligence become increasingly complex, there has never been a better time for innovative KYC solutions that offer new efficiencies. In December 2019, CTMfile reported on SWIFT opening its KYC registry to corporate customers. This was designed to ensure that both corporates and banks could benefit from a more streamlined process for KYC information collection.
In a recent webinar hosted by SWIFT, the use of the KYC Registry for corporate due diligence was discussed by Ariane Van der Eecken, Treasury Director EMEA at global technology solutions provider Avnet, Marian Owczarzy, KYC Operations Manager at HSBC, and Delphine Masquelier, SWIFT's KYC Product Manager.
Getting everyone in the same room 
One of the biggest headaches for both banks and corporates has been a lack of global standards for KYC documentation. Corporates often have to provide similar information in different formats, which adds to the administrative burden. Van der Eecken commented that SWIFT’s KYC registry as a catalyst for discussion and collaboration between banks and corporates:
“When it comes to standardisation of information, having everyone in the same room discussing how to do this is important. This discussion has helped us progress to a more harmonised KYC process.""
The importance of community feedback in order to continue to improve the platform was also highlighted. “It’s very important to get feedback to make the platform as useful as possible,"" noted SWIFT's Masquelier. ""Through listening to our customers, we found out how various standardised fields could be tweaked to help banks and corporates get the most value from the Registry.”
Simplifying KYC visibility
The importance of a universally accessible database is crucial to navigating the complex world of AML and KYC. The KYC registry offers corporates a single platform to host their documentation and single view of all their KYC information across the globe.  
“Avnet needed to centralise the KYC process, the Registry helped to understand what documents are exactly needed and where requirements can be streamlined,"" Avnet's Van der Eecken explained. ""With entities having multiple banking relationships, Avnet needed a single platform for KYC that gives an overview of what information has been shared and with whom"

""With entities having multiple banking relationships, Avnet needed a single platform for KYC that gives an overview of what information has been shared and with whom.” 
An organisation-wide effort
The implementation journey for the KYC Registry will differ for every entity, dependent on their size and scale. HSBC's Owczarzy explained that the KYC Registry became a strategic priority, which really moved the implementation process along. He also touched on how support across the bank helped the adoption process. 
“Awareness across the organisation was a priority,"" Owczarzy said. ""All the relevant parties across the bank were aware. Key stakeholders would be able to speak about the KYC Registry with their customers. On a high level it means better customer experience overall, on a practical level it means less customer outreach. If a customer fills in all the fields, customer outreach will be absolutely minimal.” 
Ozczarzy also highlighted how the Registry reduces case-loads within HSBC: “Removing the burden of exchanging information allows our relationship managers to focus on the customer as opposed to their documentation. In order for this to work, the first step would be for the customer to publish their profile. They also need to refresh their information. This must continue as we move into the future.”
“The KYC refresh notifications will allow our entities to always be up-to-date,"" added Van der Eecken. ""For example, [flagging] an expiry date on a document. This indeed will be a change in process management.”
Proof is in the pudding 
The ultimate success of the Registry in streamlining KYC processes relies on it working in tandem with other initiatives. 
“By keeping a collaborative mindset and the idea of interoperability at the forefront, we will be able to create a more complete KYC Registry,"" commented SWIFT's Masquelier. 
The KYC Registry is currently open to banks as well as corporates connected to SWIFT, including all their non-connected legal entities"

SWIFT is also looking to extend to other segments in the financial industry, such as non-bank financial institutions to further encourage the standardisation of requirements. 
The KYC challenges corporates face are shared across the industry, but Avnet's Van der Eecken said that the Registry is already making a difference: “We have seen in the first few months that this process is more standardised and streamlined because of the KYC Registry.”
For entities not yet on the KYC Registry, Masquelier concluded with a simple message: “Talk to your banks and SWIFT – the set-up can be quick. Just reach out.”"

(up 15% to US $92.61) to facilitate institutional investors with the management and trade of Bitcoin. The collaboration with BlackRock reportedly provides some relief for the largest US crypto-trading platform, whose stock had lost more than two-thirds of its value this year to date. According to reports, BlackRock clients can expect to use its Aladdin investment-management system to manage their Bitcoin exposure alongside other portfolio assets such as stocks and bonds, as well as to facilitate financing and trading on Coinbase's exchange. The partnership with Coinbase, a US crypto-trading platform, will initially focus on Bitcoin, as stated by BlackRock. The collapses of the Terra ecosystem and hedge firm Three Arrows Capital have reportedly cast doubt on the crypto market's resiliency and triggered increasing regulatory scrutiny. As a result, Bitcoin has lost approximately half of its value in 2022. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Coinbase for allegedly enabling Americans to trade digital assets that should have been registered as securities. According to Owen Lau, Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co., the regulatory risks associated with the cooperation are manageable because it is commencing with Bitcoin, which is said to have a clearer regulatory standing in Washington than other digital assets. BlackRock's Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Relationships, Joseph Chalom, stated that their institutional clients’ interest in entering the digital asset markets and learning how to effectively manage the operational life cycle of these assets is rapidly growing. According to the company, institutional investors accounted for approximately three-quarters of the $309 billion in trading volume on Coinbase in the first quarter 2022. Some of Coinbase’s clients include hedge funds, corporate treasury departments, and asset managers. This collaboration is considered part of BlackRock's larger strategy to expand into digital assets. In March 2022, Larry Fink, CEO, BlackRock, stated that the firm has been researching the importance of digital assets and stablecoins and how they can be used to assist clients.

Shaktikanta Das, Governor of the Central Bank, further stated that the overall liquidity in the system is increasing, and liquidity normalisation will be a multi-year process following the Monetary Policy Committee's interest rate decision. One important factor to consider, according to Das, is that some of the targeted long-term repo operations from the pandemic’s first year are expected to mature in 2023, causing the process to continue into the following year. Reports indicated that the liquidity of the banking system is determined by the supply and demand for central bank money. To manage liquidity, the RBI employs the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) window. The central bank reportedly lends short-term funds to banks at the repo rate (currently at 5.4%), accepting government securities as collateral, and withdraw funds from banks at the reverse repo rate through this window. The RBI is said to use the LAF framework and a variety of liquidity management tools to manage inflation by increasing and decreasing the money supply. The RBI has reportedly guaranteed that liquidity will remain in surplus at least through 2022 in efforts to reduce the pandemic-era surplus. Das stated that the central bank's actions had reduced surplus liquidity in the banking system from Rs 6.7 lakh crore in April-May to Rs 3.8 lakh crore in June-July. He attributed this to the variable rate reverse repo operations and the Standing Deposit Facility. However, Das stated that the central bank is expected to guide cash flow processes in response to fluctuating financial conditions"

But as well as the opportunities it opens up, how do we ensure AI is applied responsibly in financial services? This is the question at the heart of a new white paper released this week in Singapore, designed to guide the ethical use of AI in the sector and highlight what financial organisations, technology companies and regulators need to think about as adoption of this powerful technology grows.
“AI developments are focused on making the technology as autonomously ""intelligent"" as possible, but with growing awareness of AI’s potential implications, we also need to ensure that it is understood and that trust in it is maintained,” said Chris Bezuidenhout, Deutsche Bank’s APAC CIO and project sponsor for the Deutsche Bank team in the study.
Commenting on one of the paper’s key recommendations that a core set of principles for responsible AI should be applied globally, explained Boon-Hiong Chan, global head of Market Advocacy, Securities Services and project lead: “As AI develops further, we need to have a continuous dialogue with regulators, across the industry and with clients on how it can be applied ethically and responsibly across the board. This will help mitigate the potential complexity that would arise from multiple standards and interpretation globally and ultimately lead to better outcomes for clients.”
The paper applies Singapore’s regulatory ethical and responsible AI guidance in three specific use cases across a variety of contexts:

Enhancing customer experience - Predict consumer travel behaviour as a basis for travel related marketing.
Empowering employees to make data-driven insights - Automate verification of wet ink signatures.
Streamlining regulatory compliance - Generate insights and support decision-making for KYC compliance-related processes.

7680,3312,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/better-luck-this-time-for-eu-corporate-tax,Better luck this time for EU corporate tax?,2016-10-27,,"In a press conference in Brussels yesterday, European Commissioner Pierre Moscovici outlined the EU's latest proposals on corporate tax reforms, with a renewed plan for a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB).
Fourth time lucky?
This is an initiative that has already been put forward in 2001, in 2007 and in 2011 but Moscovici said the executive is hoping that the tax scandals in recent years (from large corporates paying very little tax, to leaked data such as the 'Luxleaks' scandal and the Panama papers) have changed public and political sentiment towards corporate taxation.
A fair tax?
The current plan aims to provide a single, EU-wide definition of taxable profits and, secondly, to establish a system for redistributing corporate tax revenue between EU member states.
Moscovici expressed the hope that the proposals “will put fairness at the heart of corporate taxation in the EU” and said he hopes to implement the EU-wide corporate tax regime by 2021, adding that “the CCCTB will also be a powerful tool against tax avoidance”.
Under the current proposal, the CCCTB will be applied to businesses with annual revenues greater than €750 million and will be mandatory for multinationals (in the previous proposal it was optional). This, Moscovici said, will prevent the large-scale tax avoidance that has been in the spotlight lately, and secure a more level playing field for all companies in the EU.
CCCTB now more relevant than ever
But with the failure of past attempts to galvanise EU member states on agreeing on a CCCTB, why does the EC think the proposals might be welcomed in 2016? Moscovici said: “a lot has changed since 2011 – in our approach, in the proposal and in the political landscape. The CCCTB is more relevant today than ever, and I am confident that we have the right conditions today to make it a reality.”
The new tax proposal breaks the transition to a CCCTB down into two steps, which Moscovici calls “much more manageable, though no less ambitious”. He also said it will “simultaneously support business, attract investors, promote growth and stop large-scale tax avoidance.”
Can it be implemented by 2021?
Some have criticised the €750 million threshold as being too high"

The new tax proposal breaks the transition to a CCCTB down into two steps, which Moscovici calls “much more manageable, though no less ambitious”. He also said it will “simultaneously support business, attract investors, promote growth and stop large-scale tax avoidance.”
Can it be implemented by 2021?
Some have criticised the €750 million threshold as being too high. To be implemented at an EU level, the proposal will need to be adopted by a unanimous vote in the Council. An enhanced cooperation agreement between supporting member states could be an alternative if there is no unanimous agreement.
The Commission has also been working to push through a Financial Transaction Tax but talks on this have not made progress and there has not been unanimous support for the initiative. Despite this Moscovici has said he hopes that the FTT talks can reach a conclusion by the end of this year.

CTMfile take: Does the Commission's proposal have teeth this time round? In the wake of numerous scandals involving corporate tax and tax havens, there may be more public and political will to see this through. Moscovici also said the CCCTB will promote competition and growth for businesses. CTMfile would love to hear what you corporates think about this. Would you welcome a common tax base within the EU? Do you think the €750 million is an effective threshold?"
7682,3313,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/south-africa-to-cap-maximum-cheque-value-from-may-2020,South Africa to cap maximum cheque value from May 2020,2019-06-21,,"The Payments Association of South Africa (PASA) is sharply reducing the maximum value for which a cheque can be written. Effective from 1 May 2020, the current value of rand 500,000 (ZAR) – equivalent to £27,440/US$34,725 – will be capped at just 10% of that figure, or ZAR 50,000.
The PASA said that it has made the decision “after careful consideration and consultation with key stakeholders.”
Walter Volker, its chief executive officer believes that the limit reduction stems from the need for better risk management and the ongoing decline in the use of cheques as a payment method. 

“Although less than 10% of signed cheques are for values above ZAR 50 000, the inherent risk of transactions above ZAR 50 000 is higher, based on potential fraud. A reduced cheque limit will thus reduce the risks associated with fraud losses and system failures,” he said

Volker added: “The use of cheques has been declining at a rapid rate of approximately 30% year on year, driven by the shift in consumer habits, with South Africans opting for the convenience and safety of digital payments.”
Other options
The PASA comments that there are a variety of interoperable digital alternatives for consumers ranging from debit and credit card-based payment solutions to electronic funds transfer (EFT) and real-time clearing (RTC) payments with future developments being designed to enable new offerings.
“Card, EFT and RTC payments have experienced significant growth as consumers and businesses adopt these payment mechanisms over cash and cheque-based payments,” it notes. “Digital payments are not only more efficient than cheques but are also safer and more convenient for consumers. 

The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has also endorsed the reduction decision, which was “informed by an extensive consultation process.” The SARB supported the decision to reduce the item limit on the basis that it supports the National Payment System (NPS) Framework and Strategy - Vision 2025 objective of promoting safer, cost-effective and efficient electronic payments in the NPS. The central bank launched the initiative in March 2018.

Volker also stressed that there would be no immediate changes. “There will be sufficient preparation within the banks to effect the system changes, and firms will have sufficient time to adapt to the new rules before 1 May 2020,” he confirmed"

Citi is expanding its withdrawal from Russia, as the country’s war on Ukraine continues to drive an exodus of Western companies. In a blog post, Citi announced the decision to widen its exit beyond the long-planned sale of its Russian retail bank.
The departure will now cover “other lines of business” in Russia, where Citi provides a range of corporate banking services. The bank said it is “moving with urgency to complete our assessment of our operations in Russia”:
“In April 2021, we announced our intent to exit our consumer business in the country. We have now decided to expand the scope of that exit process to include other lines of business and continue to reduce our remaining operations and exposure.
“Due to the nature of banking and financial services operations, this decision will take time to execute.”
Fellow US banks Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan announced last week they were pulling out of Russia and Germany’s Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have joined the exodus from Russia in recent days.
Citi said it will no longer solicit any new business or clients and is helping companies that are withdrawing from Russia.
“We are providing assistance to multi-national corporations, many of whom are undergoing the complex task of unwinding their operations.
“We will continue to manage our existing regulatory commitments and our obligations to depositors, as well as support all of our employees during this very difficult time.”
Citi's website reveals that it had about 500,000 retail clients and 3,000 corporate clients in Russia, where it provided services that included cash management, trade finance, investment banking, corporate finance, lending, FX and hedging services.
In separate news from the bank, Citi announced that it is teaming with the fintech IntraFi to create a new service that will let Citi’s corporate and institutional clients sweep any excess cash they have into US branches of foreign banks. The service, dubbed Yankee Sweep, is designed to help corporate clients manage their money better and obtain higher yields on deposits, Citi said when announcing the partnership Monday
“For treasury organisations, key aspects of effective liquidity management include managing risk, counterparty exposure, daily liquidity, and optimising yield,” it stated in the release. “In order to achieve these objectives, organisations would need to manage cash across multiple banks and/or money market funds"

Soaring nickel prices impact on supply chains
The recent surge in commodity prices has seriously impacted on the global market for nickel and related upstream and downstream industries, said the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association (CMRA), following an unprecedented spike in global nickel futures at the London Metal Exchange (LME) last week.
Nickel is a key raw material for the production of stainless steel and new energy batteries, with the latter being an important item in countries embracing green development, especially China, where new energy vehicles have become a pillar industry for low-carbon transformation.

In the two days 7 and 8 March the LME nickel futures rose by 174%, which triggered an announcement that all nickel trading on Tuesday 8th would be cancelled and not resumed before Friday. According to reports, the price spike was likely to have been triggered by China’s giant Tsingshan Holding Group, which holds a large number of short bets on the LME"

According to reports, the price spike was likely to have been triggered by China’s giant Tsingshan Holding Group, which holds a large number of short bets on the LME.
The LME defended the temporary suspension and cancellation, saying the market had become disorderly with prices not reflecting the physical market. The CMRA agreed, commenting: “Current nickel prices have seriously deviated from the fundamentals, losing the guidance significance to the spot market,” adding that soaring prices cause serious harm to the global supply chain. The association said it would monitor the situation closely and urged industry participants to maintain market order, preventing irrational price spikes in nonferrous products
The nickel price fluctuation came as Western sanctions against Russia widened, including the exclusion of Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system. As Russia's nickel ore accounts for 11% of the global supply, and its pure nickel accounts for 20%, the impact is not surprising, analysts said.
The Shanghai Futures Exchange suspended trading in some nickel contracts for a day starting from the evening trading session on Wednesday 9 March, in response to speculation after the global price fluctuations.

Many international traders are also monitoring the situation. Analysts report that upstream companies are less willing to take new orders, while downstream industry participants are looking at contingency measures to cope with the potential supply shortage and price rise.

An announcement posted by Tesla China’s official website on 10 March stated that prices of the car manufacturer’s Model 3 high-performance version and the Model Y long-range and high-performance version had increased. The rise was about yuan (CNY) 10,000 (US$1,570), according to media reports. The current domestic Model Y high-performance versions use ternary lithium batteries, which contain nickel-cobalt and other precious metals.

However, the CMRA is hopeful that longer-term the expansion of the cooperation and investment with Indonesian nickel partners could help ease the supply chain problems and price pressures. In 2021, Indonesia became the world’s largest nickel producer, which according to the industry association was the result of a combination of Chinese technology and capital with Indonesian resources"

Santander and Agrotoken develop grain-backed tokens
Santander has taken a step into the crypto industry by offering loans backed by agricultural commodity tokens. The Spanish bank has partnered with Agrotoken, an Argentinian start-up that developed a group of grain-backed tokens that enable producers to transact with their commodities.
Argentinian producers have already validated the software product in a pilot exercise. Santander reports that the product is innovative in linking financial products with agricultural tokens, including blockchain services to facilitate transactions.
“This is the first global experience in backing loans with tokens based on agrocommodities such as soya beans, corn and wheat,” said Eduardo Novillo Astrada, CEO and co-founder of Agrotoken. “Together with Santander, we are creating a number of financial products to provide farmers with a service where they can easily access a new system of credits backed by the sale of their grains.”
Fernando Bautista, head of Agribusiness at Santander Argentina added: “At Santander Argentina, we are leveraging technology and innovation to generate new business solutions thatmake life easier for farmers and expand their opportunities. This is the first time that a financial services platform has used blockchain and cryptoassets technology to expand the agricultural credit market and unlock the farmer’s business potential.”
Santander says that the product represents several milestones, as it is the first time that a global financial services platform connects tokens based on agricultural products to financial products. It is also a new experience using blockchain technology to generate new businesses and make the process more efficient. Furthermore, it is the first collateral generated from cryptoassets based on agricultural products"

It is also a new experience using blockchain technology to generate new businesses and make the process more efficient. Furthermore, it is the first collateral generated from cryptoassets based on agricultural products.
Each token represents one tonne of grain sold and delivered by the farmer to a wholesaler. In addition, these tonnes of grain are also validated through a Proof of Grain Reserve (PoGR) certificate, a system that is always transparent, secure, decentralised and auditable through a modern security infrastructure.
Once the farmers have their digital assets, the agrotokens can be used to carry out various transactions, reflecting the three price indices set in aggregate with the Matba Rofex group, which reflect in real time the value of the grains.
Since January 2021, several transactions have been carried out that demonstrate the usability of cryptoassets in exchange for different types of supplies, trucks, machinery and farms.
Santander adds that is focusing on technology to provide more and better services, as evidenced by its plan to invest US$225 million in this sector and in Argentina, as Ana Botín, its group executive chairman, announced last November when she visited the country.
 
Jamaica offers user incentive as it launches CBDC
The Jamaican government has said that the first 100,000 citizens to use the country’s new central bank digital currency (CBDC) – known as Jamaica Digital Exchange (Jam-Dex) – due to be launched at the start of April, will receive a free J$2,500 (US$16) payment to encourage widespread adoption. 
Jamaican prime minister Andrew Holness announced the incentive in a Facebook post on 10 March to a mixed reception. While some Facebook users praised Holness for “embracing a digital future” others expressed concern about the motivations of the Jamaican government, accusing Holness of trying to “bribe” citizens into the federal banking system.

The Jamaica Observer reports that one in six of the Jamaican population is currently unbanked and the initiative will encourage low and middle-income consumers to join the national banking system.
The initiative forms part of the government’s digital transformation of Jamaica’s economy. Dr Clarke said that any individual with an existing bank account can automatically be eligible for a Jam-Dex digital wallet. “If you don’t have a bank account, all that is required to set up a Jam-Dex-enabled wallet are simplified Know Your Customer information: name, address, date of birth, tax registration number (TRN), and a valid government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s licence, passport, or voter identification card. Of course, once the national identification system (NIDS) is fully implemented, this will be accepted.”
The finance minister added that the government hopes more merchants such as corner shops, vendors, and bars will accept Jam-Dex and make its use more widespread to achieve success. The government is also looking to incentivise businesses to set up electronic wallets and to conduct payments in Jam-Dex. The government and central bank will also push for the BOJ to be the sole issuer.

Eastern Caribbean Central Bank DCash service resumes
The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) says full functionality of the DCash digital payments platform was restored on 9 March, following a power outage on 14 January that interrupted the service for nearly two months. DCash is the digital version of the Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar.
“As part of the restoration, the platform now benefits from several upgrades including an enhanced certificate management process and an updated version of the software which provides the foundation for the DCash system,” the ECCB announced on its website. “Extensive testing and assurance exercises were conducted prior to restoration of the platform to ensure full functionality of the service in accordance with quality assurance specifications.”

However, the lengthy disruption to DCash has caused some analysts to question the reliability of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)"

The ECCB, as the monetary authority of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), has the sole authority to mint, issue, and redeem DCash.
 Seven of the eight ECCB member countries are currently enrolled in the DCash pilot, with Anguilla set to join soon. Further promised developments in the pipeline include the introduction of an e-commerce function, which will enable businesses to accept DCash via their websites, and the rollout of government to consumer payments. The free DCash app is available for download in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
 
Nigeria’s central bank promotes cash collection centres
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has released a series of guidelines for the registration and operation of Bank Neutral Cash Hubs (BNCHs) across the country, including minimum limits of naira (₦) 500,000 (US$1,200) for individuals and ₦ 1 million for corporates in transactions with a BNCH.
“The CBN, in collaboration with the Banker’s Committee, initiated the Nigerian Cash Management System, which seeks to reduce cost and improve operational efficiency in the country’s cash management value chain,” the bank announced.
“One initiative towards the stated goal is the introduction of BNCHs [which] are cash collection centres to be established by registered processing companies or Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) based on business needs. They will be located in areas with high volumes of commercial activities and cash transactions.”
The central bank added that the hubs would provide platforms for customers to make cash deposits and receive value irrespective of the bank with which their accounts are domiciled. “This guideline aims to provide minimum standards and requirements for BNCH registration and operations for effective supervision.
“The key objective is to reduce the risks and costs borne by banks, merchants and huge cash handlers in the course of cash management activities. It will also deepen financial inclusion and leverage on shared services to enhance cash management efficiency"

However, the activities that BNCHs are not permitted to carry out include investing lending and any transactions involving foreign currency.
According to local press reports, the CBN, experts and industry players in Nigeria have expressed worry over the rising cost and risks of cash handling. “This led to a potpourri of policies aimed at advancing the cause of cashless transactions, with the current and former central bankers admitting the system must find a way to reduce the cost and risk.
   
“There have been challenges accessing cash at automated teller machines (ATMs), with the situation degenerating into a crisis point during the recent Yuletide. Inside sources have hinted that the banks were becoming increasingly worried about risks posed to cash in transit (CIT).” 
   
The situation reached a point where “banks were shying away from the responsibility of cash management, owing to the rising risk, thus under-servicing cash points, including ATM and creating hurdles around the across-the-counter withdrawal.
“In remote communities and even within the metropolis, ATMs are deactivated at night as deliberate protective measures for the banks.”  
 
Treasure Financial develops Treasure Cash
Treasure Financial, the San Francisco-based B2B fintech company launched in 2016, announced the launch of a new product called Treasure Cash, an allocation within its Treasure Reserve account, which it says enables businesses to earn 15 times more on their idle cash with 10 times higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance, zero market risk and daily liquidity.
In its release Treasure, which focuses on cash management solutions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with annual revenue of US$5 million to US$100 million in revenue, commented: “When it comes to managing idle cash, businesses previously had limited tools at their disposal, but Treasure is rapidly filling that void.

“We’re excited to add this new allocation to Treasure Reserve which is our idle cash management offering,” says Sam Strasser, Treasure CEO. “With Treasure Cash businesses can generate revenue from their idle cash like big corporations do. This ultra-safe offering which doesn’t bear any market risk, complements Treasure’s High Yield allocation generating up to 100x more.”
The release states that US businesses are frustrated with the lack of services and expensive fees they pay with their banks. According to Bankrate, banks receive a minuscule yield, on average.03%, from their business bank accounts.
With the Treasure platform customers can easily sign up online, add information about their business and typically have their Treasure Reserve account open by the next business day. From there they have the ability to deploy their idle cash into different options such as Treasure Cash or Treasure High Yield to maximise the revenue they can make out of their idle cash. All these services are provided with a seamless digital experience.

£7.2bn: revenue opportunity created by open banking by 2022
71%: of SMEs expected to adopt it by 2022
64%: of adults expected to be adopters by 2022
48%: of retail banking customers state security is their biggest concern.

What is Open Banking and why does it matter?
PwC is a believer in Open Banking, e.g. “Whatever the motivation and the mechanism for its introduction and despite the potential pitfalls, the application of Open Banking principles could significantly change the shape of banking for the better.”
UK’s Open Banking standard’s framework sets out how to develop a set of standards, tools, techniques and processes that will stimulate competition and innovation in the country’s financial sector. (The European Parliament adopted the revised payment services directive (PSD2) to make it easier, faster, and less expensive for customers to pay for goods and services, by promoting innovation especially by third-party providers. PSD2 does provide the legal framework within which the Open Banking standard in the UK and future efforts at creating other national Open Banking standards in Europe will have to operate.
Although the initial objectives of the Open Banking standards were to increase competition in banking and increase current account switching, the intent is continuingly evolving
with a broader focus on areas including reduced overdraft fees, improved customer service, greater control of data and increased financial inclusion.

Potential Open Banking enabled propositions (non-exhaustive)

Remember that the report estimated that 71%: of SMEs and 64% of adults are expected to be adopters by 2022. This is a huge opportunity but also a huge threat to current suppliers of services to these sectors, e.g. what if a fintech spotted how to provide a current service and expand it into an area, a service that your company currently provides?
Rethinking banking services
This is a pretty standard list of the potential applications of Open Banking, but many of these potential applications could offer opportunities for improved corporate efficiency, cash flows and liquidity to other companies, e.g.:

Process improvement
	
New identity verification and KYC processes
Dynamic payroll and faster international remittance services


Bespoke lending based on spending data 
Cash flow management based on cash balances and future cash flows
Integrated accounting services, audit and tax planning services.

These services are typically carried out by banks, fintechs and consultancies, but could your company and treasury get inside these processes and add them to an existing service of yours?
Already treasury management systems are linking to personal wallets and downloading details of the balances to enable corporate treasury departments to understand how much spending power resides in these wallets.
How could your company, your corporate treasury department:

Become involved in your SME suppliers’ or vendors’ cash flows to provide loan or deposit services?
Provide loan or deposit services to your retail customers?
Etc.

Morgan. Of those respondents that reported increased fraud activity at their organisations, nearly two-thirds of treasury and finance professionals (65%) believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is to blame for some of the uptick in payments fraud at their companies.
BEComing a nuisance
Furthermore, business email compromise (BEC) continues to be the primary source for attempted or actual payments fraud, as 62% of companies that experienced attempted or actual payments fraud in 2020 did so as a result of BEC. Although the percentage of companies financially impacted by BEC has been declining, over three-quarters of respondents (76%) report that their organisation had been targeted by BEC attempts in 2020.
Accounts payable (AP) departments are the most susceptible to BEC fraud. Sixty-one percent of respondents report that their AP department is most often vulnerable to BEC.
""While the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly impacted how organisations operate, employees must continue to be watchful of fraudulent activity and they must have access to the training and education needed to detect the same,"" said Jim Kaitz, president and CEO of AFP. ""Our working environment may have changed, but it is even more crucial to be vigilant now and remember that fraud is still prevalent – whether we are working from the office or not.""
An ever-present threat to treasurers
In 2020, 74% of organisations were targets of payment scams. While that is smaller than the shares reported in 2018 and 2019, it still indicates that a large percentage of companies continue to be impacted by payments fraud.
According to 77% of treasury and finance practitioners, educating employees on the threat of BEC and training them to identify spear phishing attempts is an important component in controlling this most prevalent of fraud methods.
In 2020, cheques and wire transfers continued to be the payment methods most impacted by fraud activity (66% and 39%, respectively). However, the incidence of cheque fraud activity is on a decline and the cheque fraud activity observed showed an 8-percentage-point decrease from last year.

It’s unfortunate that what was a maxim originally offered to politicians has also been adopted by fraudsters, ever ready to exploit the opportunities created by sudden events. If the economic carnage wrought by the coronavirus crisis wasn’t enough for governments and businesses to contend with, recent weeks have brought reports of financial institutions and corporates being targeted by sophisticated criminals employing a variety of techniques to initiate payments purportedly relating to the pandemic. Google is reported to have set up a Covid-19 task force, whose priorities include preventing unemployment benefit scams. Both pre-coronavirus and since the outbreak began, social engineering, business email compromise and vendor payment targeting have been among the favourite techniques employed by bad actors to fraudulently initiate payments. These techniques are accompanied by newer tactics that target treasury management and accounts payable teams with scams attempting to deploy malware to corrupt account information and reroute payments to fraudulent accounts or to steal proprietary information to extort money. To support its clients in fending off such attacks, Deutsche Bank issued the notice Warning of cyber attacks related to the coronavirus pandemic in April, providing information to clients on how to identify the scam e-mails, text messages and social media posts that have been spawned by the Covid-19 crisis. More recently, cybersecurity and fraud prevention were discussed in several webinars across the globe hosted by the bank"

Since Covid-19 moved from a local to a global issue, the bank has alerted clients to cyber criminals masquerading as reputable authorities who exploit the fear and uncertainty triggered by the pandemic by using business email compromise (BEC), text messages and social media posts purporting to provide information on the coronavirus. These types of fraudulent messages are used to entice a company’s employees to reveal sensitive information, such as log-in data for online accounts, credit card details and mobile phone numbers through fake websites. In some cases, individuals are invited to click on attachments or links, which promptly infect their computer or smartphone with malware that could access sensitive data or encrypt it for the purpose of extortion. Industry information suggests a steady increase in the incidence of attempted and successful payment frauds and cyber threats. The US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) has stated that losses resulting from business email compromise (BEC) alone reaches into the billions of dollars. Recent reports give an estimated figure for 2019 from BEC losses of US$1.7bn. As reported cases of coronavirus began to rise steadily in early April, the FBI warned that BEC schemes using the pandemic as a cover were expected to rise further. Cyber security is attracting greater attention and publicity as a result, in contrast to 20 years ago when the level of interest was minimal. The first recorded major ransomware attack spread by infected email attachments, dubbed CryptoLocker, did not make major headlines until 2013-14, when the perpetrators targeted more than 500,000 machines and reportedly extorted around US$3m from victims.

“But it doesn't mean they are fully ready, in fact far from it,” he warned in a BBC radio interview.
The BoE governor also estimates that around 150,000 businesses still lack the paperwork necessary for continuing to export to the European Union (EU) should a no-deal Brexit become a reality, and that although many companies have built up their inventories, stocks were likely to be exhausted within weeks.
“Business will be reliant on what the governments are able to do in order to keep the ports open, the trade flowing,” he commented, adding that the UK’s financial system was rather better prepared for a no-deal scenario.
Tariffs to return
Mr Carney emphasised that if the UK leaves the EU on October 31 with a deal still not agreed, the re-imposition of trade tariffs on goods shipped to the EU would be “automatic”.
His assertion contradicts a claim from Boris Johnson, currently expected to succeed Theresa May as prime minister that the UK could secure a 10-year standstill in current arrangements using an article of the EU’s General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, aka Gatt 24.
“The Gatt rules are clear. they apply if you have a [withdrawal] agreement, not if you've decided not to have an agreement, or you have been unable to come to an agreement,” Mr Carney said.
“So we should be clear that not having an agreement with the EU would mean that there are tariffs, automatically, because the Europeans have to apply the same rules to us as they apply to everyone else.”
Facebook’s crypto
The BoE governor said that he was open to Facebook’s plan to launch its own cryptocurrency, Libra, in Q1 2020,which he would approach ""with an open mind but not an open door"". Nonetheless, central banks around the world would be setting “ground rules upfront” to protect consumers and their data. Libra “had to be safe or it is not going to happen”.
“Welcome to the world of finance: there is oversight, there is consumer protection, there is market integrity, people have certain rights to privacy that have to be respected, he added"

“And we're not going to allow a network that comes into place that is a network for criminals and terrorists.”
Facebook has issued assurances that Libra will be independently managed, backed by real assets and pegged to a basket of well-known currencies. These have not dispelled concerns over how people’s data and cash will be protected, as well as the currency's potential volatility.
Mr Carney said: “All the major global central banks and supervisors would have direct regulatory control of this if it is going to work, which is an open question, and we have an open mind about it.”"

A final report from the expert group, which is chaired by Christian Thimann, is due at the end of 2017.
The report recommends:

quick action to include a classification system for sustainable assets;
a European standard and label for green bonds;
fiduciary duty that encompasses sustainability;
better disclosure from financial institutions and companies on how sustainability is factored into decision-making; and
a 'sustainability test' for relevant EU financial legislation.

Although not part of the current report's recommendations, the expert group will also continue to consider the following policy areas:

integrating sustainability considerations in ratings;
improved transparency requirements for listed companies; and
increasing the level of sustainable investments through stable, long-term policy frameworks and a strong pipeline of sustainable projects.

The work done by the expert group is part of the Commission's strategy on sustainable finance and its Capital Markets Union (CMU) initiative but it also aims to address the challenge of climate change, as one of the group's members, Ingrid Holmes, told Euractiv. 
Holmes lists some of the conclusions reached by the expert group, which include:

EU countries should develop detailed national capital raising plans setting out what is needed in terms of sustainable infrastructure and how private sector investment will be attracted to finance that infrastructure;
the EU budget’s multi-annual financial framework should be revised to exclude support for unsustainable investments and the EU’s public banks should lead the way in a complete shift away from unsustainable investment;
part of the EU budget should be dedicated to allowing more private sector investors to take an active role in funding projects that meet Europe’s social objectives and an EU sustainable fund label should be developed to give confidence to citizen investors to get involved in investing in a more sustainable European future.

The survey of more than 1,100 corporate executives earlier this year highlighted several problems with the KYC process globally.
1. Lack of KYC standard
The research found that one of the main problems facing corporates – and their banking partners – is that there is no global standard for know your customer (KYC) regulations, so different banks will have varying documentary requirements for their corporate customers. The report states: “Survey respondents reported an average of 10 global banking relationships — each one placing different demands on corporates, resulting in frustration, rising costs and wasted time.” Corporates were also frustrated with having to deal with many different people within the bank.
2. Contact with too many people within bank
The report – KYC compliance: the rising challenge for corporates – also found a disparity in the amount of contact required between corporates and their financial institutions during the KYC process. The FIs said that they need to contact corporate clients on average four times during the KYC compliance, while corporates reported an average of eight times.
3. Companies not reporting material changes
Another issue that was highlighted in the survey was reporting material changes within the organisation, such as a merger or change of a key executive role. The complexity involved in reporting such changes is deterring corporates from making their banking partners aware of the changes. Thomson Reuters found that companies had on average six material changes in the two-year period before the survey – but just 30 per cent reported these changes to their partner FIs. It's not hard to see why: the average time corporates spend updating their FIs about material changes is now 30 days, up from 27 days in 2016.
4. Security concerns
Concerns over security and who is viewing documents is also an important issue for corporates, partly because the documents required for KYC include the personal documents (such as passports) of company directors.
5. Compliance is taking longer
Complying with KYC regulations is also taking longer for corporates and companies are now spending an average of 26 days on the process, up from 23 days in 2016. However, corporate customers claim that, on average, they are spending 32 days on KYC compliance"

However, corporate customers claim that, on average, they are spending 32 days on KYC compliance. And half of FI respondents thought the time taken to onboard was likely to increase in the coming year.
6. 12% changed banks because of KYC
The survey also found that 12 per cent of companies said they had changed banks as a result of KYC issues.
The research was carried out in April and May 2017 and gathered responses from 1,122 corporate decision-makers from the UK, Germany, South Africa, the United States, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and France in roles including treasury, risk management, compliance, finance directors, financial controllers, procurement, corporate secretaries and general counsel.

When it comes down to the practical processes of passing or repealing financial legislation, President Trump is about to find out that change won't be easy or quick. Following the financial crisis of 2008, it took years to implement Dodd-Frank – The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, to give it its full name. Repealing or cutting back the legislation is therefore likely to be a lengthy process if standard legal procedures are adhered to. For now, Trump has ordered regulators to produce a study on financial rules within 120 days: the Treasury secretary must consult members of different regulatory agencies and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, then report back. Trump also promised that he will be “doing a big one on Dodd-Frank”, calling the reforms “a disaster”.
What will Trump change?
Quite what “doing a big one” actually means isn't yet clear but according to an article in Bloomberg, it's likely that Trump will aim to prune the following aspects of the legislation:

a requirement for risky financial companies to be subject to tough Federal Reserve oversight;
rules for dismantling failed banks;
the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks from making market bets with their own capital (proprietary trading);
the remit and operation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that seeks to make sure financial institutions and companies treat US consumers fairly.

Trump will face challenges
Trump is likely to put Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and Steve Mnuchin, who is nominee for Treasury Secretary, in charge of his review of Dodd-Frank. However, it's likely that there will be challenges to overcome if he's going to fulfil his promise of dismantling Dodd-Frank:

the Trump administration doesn’t have any of its appointees running the agencies that oversee financial rules – including the SEC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
congress will have to pass new legislation for many Dodd-Frank regulations to be eased;

congress will have to pass new legislation for many Dodd-Frank regulations to be eased;
the president’s decision to put two former Goldman Sachs partners in charge of the effort has increased opposition from Democrats.

Criticism of Dodd-Frank
The Dodd-Frank Act isn't perfect and has come under fire for stunting the growth of small businesses by restricting bank credit to them. The reform also promised to get rid of the 'too big to fail' banks but some of Wall St's biggest institutions are bigger now than they were before the 2008 crisis.
Trump unlikely to protect consumers
Many aspects of the stated intentions to undo the Dodd-Frank Act reforms are deeply troubling. Elements such as the Volker Rule and oversight requirements for risky entities are there to strengthen the financial system and prevent another 2008-style credit crunch. And it really bares repeating that the full name of the reform – The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act – is a clue to one of the key purposes of the legislation: consumer protection. It therefore seems likely that significant rollbacks of the Act will expose US consumers to more financial risk. If there was any doubt that protecting consumers is not high on Trump's agenda, last week he also signed a presidential memorandum instructing the Labor Department to delay bringing in an Obama-era rule requiring financial professionals to put their clients' interests first when giving advice on retirement investments.
Good news for Wall St
Both Mnuchin and Cohn are former Goldman Sachs executives and Trump said on Friday that Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, is also advising him on the reform of Dodd-Frank. The news that Trump had ordered a review of the legislation was greeted on Friday by a rise in bank shares, including those of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, which rose by 4 per cent and 3 per cent respectively"
7715,3327,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/why-treasury-needs-a-seat-at-the-jv-negotiating-table,Why treasury needs a seat at the JV negotiating table,2016-04-28,,"A report from McKinsey shows that trust, communication and focusing on businesses models are linchpins of successful joint venture negotiations. Treasury has a role to play in these key areas.
One of the first things to address in any joint venture (JV) negotiations is the JV structure and business model, which accounts for 40 per cent of value at risk but just 20 per cent of the average negotiating time between potential JV partners, according to research by McKinsey.
The graph below shows how half of all meetings are spent discussing deal terms, yet these account for just 10 per cent of value at risk. This shows that JV negotiations are often inefficient in terms of how time is allocated compared to value at risk. More resources should be dedicated to the business model and structure. There is an opportunity for corporate treasury to make the case for greater involvement at the early stages of JV negotiation to ensure that decisions on structure and business models are properly informed by financial considerations such as regulations, risk management and cash flows.

Effective internal communication and trust is also one of the linchpins of successful JV negotiations. In their report McKinsey's authors, Eileen Kelly Rinaudo and Jason Roswig, write: “Negotiating JVs differs from negotiating mergers or acquisitions because the end goal is a sustainable, ongoing, trust-based relationship, not a one-time deal. Not surprisingly, a significant portion of our survey’s respondents indicated that the level of honesty and trust between the parent companies had a significant impact on the partnership’s overall success.”
While trust and communication reach far beyond the basic financials to the highest levels of the company and include honesty regarding business motivations, there is certainly a case to be argued that trusted, transparent financial data can form the foundations of good communication and trust between the two potential JV partners.

McKinsey's research also highlighted how many companies entering into JV partnerships do not have experienced negotiation teams, partly because staff members change and partly because many companies don't embark on that many JVs. Therefore there is a lack of standardised processes, which can also cause delays or hiccups along the road to partnership. McKinsey's researchers write: “Standardized processes are especially helpful once a deal is under way, when adapting and restructuring can strengthen a partnership and increase financial returns – as long as the relationship is strong and the process has clearly allowed for adaptation"

In the past 10 years there have been more than 1,500 JV deals completed each year and 10 per cent of these were JVs with an initial value of more than $250 million. And the pace seems likely to increase, with two-third of executives interviewed by McKinsey in 2014 expecting to do more JVs in future.

Firstly, Visa and Conferma Pay have announced a strategic partnership to launch Visa Commercial Pay, a suite of B2B payment solutions that are designed to help improve cash flow for businesses and eliminate manual processes.
Virtual commercial cards have never been more necessary than today, the two firms say. Remote workers are turning to personal cards to pay for corporate expenses, buyers and suppliers need more efficient ways to pay and get paid, and businesses need immediate visibility into their company spend to improve cash flow and mitigate risk efficiently. Visa Commercial Pay provides card programme management capabilities, including on-demand virtual card issuance to employees’ mobile devices via an app, created by Conferma Pay and Visa, for Visa’s commercial clients. The solution also aims to simplify money movement between buyers and suppliers, and features enhanced data, automated payment processing and expense reconciliation.
With virtual commercial cards at its core, Visa Commercial Pay features the following three B2B payment offerings for financial institutions and their corporate customers:
Visa Commercial Pay Mobile
A Visa-branded app, developed by Conferma Pay and Visa for Visa’s commercial clients, will host digitally-issued Visa virtual commercial cards on employee and contractors’ mobile devices. The app brings businesses enhanced tools and features, enabling users to manage and track spend, and lessen the dependency on issuing and mailing physical cards.

It provides a range of features to help companies better manage cash flow and capture enhanced data for reconciliation and reporting capabilities. Companies can select the optimal solution for them, either a single comprehensive programme management platform or an integrated solution into third party procurement platforms.
“The launch of Visa Commercial Pay in partnership with Conferma Pay allows us to accelerate B2B money movement away from slow, outdated methods to fast, data-rich, secure digital payments and give businesses better control over their finances,"" commented Kevin Phalen, global head of Visa Business Solutions.
“With a new economic environment, the controls to decentralise payments have to be put in place and with employees working from home, the ability to monitor, reconcile and approve spend becomes far more difficult,” added Simon Barker, CEO at Conferma Pay. “With the Visa Commercial Pay initiative, we are excited to partner with Visa and help businesses gain greater visibility and control over B2B spend whilst drastically improving the payment experience for buyers, suppliers, company contractors and employees.”
Visa says that its commercial clients can use the suite of solutions across multiple commercial-spend use cases, without any additional development or operational complexity that often comes with launching new capabilities. Financial institutions can use Visa’s new set of flexible virtual card capabilities in their entirety or a la carte, in order to quickly meet their clients’ needs.
Simplifying expense management
In other commercial card news this week, BBVA has developed Global Commercial Cards, a solution designed to allow companies to have greater control of employees’ use of commercial cards simplifying the processes of expense submission and approval.
The solution, globally developed and available in eight countries, is aimed for corporate clients to help simplify and optimise corporate expenses paid using BBVA commercial cards.
“With Global Commercial Cards, BBVA has managed to bridge the gap between two worlds: commercial cards and expense management tools,"" claims Sergio Ortega, head of global commercial cards solution at BBVA Enterprise Clients. ""To achieve it, it has used technology and data enabling companies to manage their employees’ expenses in a much more agile and simple way, while keeping control and end to end traceability throughout the whole process"

""To achieve it, it has used technology and data enabling companies to manage their employees’ expenses in a much more agile and simple way, while keeping control and end to end traceability throughout the whole process.”
The solution tailors to the needs of all types of companies, regardless of their size - whether global, regional or local - and expedites the workload of all stakeholders involved in the expense management process, from financial to human resources through purchasing and business trips areas providing quick and easy access to all the relevant information.
The solution is in charge of centralising all the expenses and automatically sending them to the expense management tool or enterprise resource planning system (ERP) chosen by the company. Global Commercial Cards is integrated with expense management tools such as SAP Concur, Captio by Emburse, Expensify, Certify by Emburse or Visa IntelliLink Spend Management, with which the activation of the service is almost immediate.
The solution is available for commercial cards issued in Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay; and all of them can be used worldwide.
Paradigm shift
“In the current context, strongly influenced by the coronavirus crisis, the way of managing corporate expenses is evolving and there is an increasing demand for digital processes which enable homogeneous global corporate expenses management,"" explains Ortega. ""The launch of Global Commercial Cards allows BBVA to meet these needs and take a further step in its commitment to offering innovative solutions which put technology at the service of companies.”
With the solution, the usage of BBVA commercial cards will not only benefit employees, who will have a secure and universally accepted payment solution which circumvents the use of cash or their consumer card. It will also allow companies to be able to more efficiently control how much, when and on what the employee spends their money, making the management of these payments much easier - traditionally associated with tedious and poorly optimised processes"

In the last few months, there has also been acceleration in RMB usage with the emergence of other offshore RMB clearing centres worldwide, including several countries outside of Asia-Pacific. These additional clearing centres include Bangkok, Doha, Frankfurt, Kuala Lumpur, Luxembourg, Paris, Seoul, Toronto and more recently Sydney. They represent the largest share of offshore countries, excluding Hong Kong, using RMB for payments.Overall shareSWIFT’s RMB Tracker report concludes that, “In February 2015, the RMB fell back to position #7 as world payments currency with a share of 1.81%. This represents a decrease of 20.4% compared to last month, which is likely due to the seasonal effect of the Chinese New Year. Payments across all currencies decreased in value by 9.3% in that same period.

The collaboration is part of the bank’s technology strategy that will build on its multi-cloud approach. The collaboration will add Google Cloud to the bank’s portfolio of technologies, as it aims to deploy smarter technology and better experiences to its customers across the UK.
Lloyds says that, benefiting from Google Cloud’s engineering capability, the collaboration will use advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning to create more personalised customer experiences, delivered faster to market.
“As the UK’s largest digital bank we have made strong progress in transforming not only our systems, but also how we work,” said Zaka Mian, group transformation director at Lloyds Banking Group. “The size of our digital transformation is huge and Google Cloud’s capabilities will help drive this forward, increasing the pace of innovation, as well as bringing new services to our customers quickly and at scale.”
Over the course of the five-year agreement, Lloyds will deploy a number of Google Cloud services which will support its ambition to streamline, modernise and improve the customer experience. The collaboration will combine expertise, explore the new technologies that are reshaping the industry and offer the potential for quicker and easier customer transactions.
“Banking customers today expect secure access to their funds, without downtime, and delivered through the modern experiences they receive in other aspects of their lives,” said Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud CEO. “We are proud to work with such an established institution as Lloyds, working with them on one of the biggest digital transformation journeys to redefine the next generation of financial services.”"

The service was showcased at the Mastercard Cybersecurity Summit in Croatia.
Cyber criminals are relentless in their efforts to exploit weaknesses in authorisation systems. According to the Boston Consulting Group, cyber attacks hit financial services firms 300 times more often than companies in other industries. With cyber attacks on the rise, implementing fraud technology tools may not be enough to mitigate the risk. Threat Scan complements an issuer’s existing fraud tools by proactively imitating known criminal transaction behaviour to assess their authorisation system responses before exploitation and fraud loss can occur.
“Our customers increasingly rely on us to provide solutions that help make their systems safer and more secure,"" said Johan Gerber, executive vice president, Security and Cyber Innovation at Mastercard. ""Threat Scan enables our customers to stay one step ahead, act faster and minimise the risks that expose them to attacks. As cyber attacks grow in scale and sophistication, it is critical that we advance trust in our payments system.”
How it works
Using an evolving array of test scenarios from Mastercard global insights into criminal behaviours, the Threat Scan application simulates known fraudulent attacks on issuers and pinpoints authorisation security weaknesses.  As cyber criminals identify new ways to gain access into a system, the scenarios can be added to the range of tests and instantly ran against systems globally. When the scan is completed, issuers will see the results immediately in the Threat Scan application report pane. The resulting insights enable issuers to assess their fraud exposure and take targeted actions that shore up the weakest links in their defences before fraud occurs.
“Threat Scan is part of our multi-layered security strategy to secure the payments ecosystem,"" said Gerber. ""Customers who participated in our pilot told us they gained valuable insights into how to secure their authorisation systems against future attacks. Many were surprised by what we found.”"
7724,3332,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/regulation-data-and-cloud-are-emerging-priorities-for-us-companies,"Regulation, data and Cloud are emerging priorities for US companies",2017-10-20,,"The biggest challenges facing organisations are regulatory compliance, data analytics and Cloud transformation. This is according to a survey by US-based management consultant firm Point B. The survey found that customer experience and employee engagement were also key issues, defined in the survey as “top emerging initiatives of absolute importance to their organisations”.
According to Point B's Chuck Ritter, companies are wasting an average of $97 million for every $1 billion invested due to poor project performance. The implication is that they could do much better in managing these key areas. The company outlines the following advice for improving the main business priority areas:
Data & analytics
Most companies have more data than they are able to analyse. Point B claims that “the real difference between high performers and those drowning in a sea of useless metrics” is the ability to efficiently capture relevant data and then use that to directly link to and impact business decisions and business strategy.
Regulatory compliance
Point B states: “From Brussels to Boston to Bangkok, the regulatory landscape in most industries changes daily. Demands are high and steadily increasing, creating risk and complexity at every juncture where even “local” companies face fallout from global regulators. Organizations must reach a state that is not only compliant, but also thrives by leveraging extensive regulatory expertise, coupled with governance design skills.”
Cloud transformation
Point B states: “The majority of Cloud projects stall or fail to meet promised results. Moves to the Cloud at the app-level, or even the system level, are likely to transfer existing headaches to a new location – and not deliver the desired transformation. While the promises of the Cloud are impressive, making the move to the Cloud a business decision – not just a technology one – is key to harnessing the Cloud’s true power. Built right, a Cloud strategy can improve collaboration and access to information, reduce costs, and modernise operations.”"

Private companies will have to comply with the rules by 1 January 2020. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) lease accounting standards are said to be “some of the most significant changes to lease accounting to date” and will require companies that are lessees to recognise the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets, increasing transparency and comparability among organisations that lease buildings, equipment, and other assets.
The survey by KPMG found that:

15 per cent of companies have already completed their implementations;
45 per cent are in the process of implementing;
most companies rely on external accounting advice from the Big 4 accounting firms; and
around half of companies said that technology will be critical to streamlining implementation efforts and costs associated.

Implications for tax, reporting, IT
KPMG’s Marybeth Shamrock commented that, from experience she has seen that “companies still have a lot of work to do in order to achieve compliance with the lease accounting standards”. According to the survey, companies expect significant implementation costs due to the new lease accounting rules. These costs are expected to range from $250,000 to more than $500,000 – and more than a quarter of respondents expect costs to exceed half-a-million dollars. Shamrock added: “The new requirements call for a substantial change in the way companies account for all their leases – from office space to heavy equipment, trucks and airplanes – and will have implications throughout the organisation, including tax, reporting, and technology.”
Unexpected challenges and budget overspend
A KPMG study published in October last year found that companies are struggling to implement software and processes in preparation for the FASB lease accounting rules and encountering problems such as:

Nearly 60 per cent indicated that they have been surprised by some of the challenges they are running up against, including identifying embedded leases and selecting and implementing an adequate leasing system.
Forty per cent of companies also said their leasing implementation costs are exceeding the amount budgeted a year ago, caused largely by a realisation that they will need new lease accounting software and having to spend more time than expected to identify, abstract, and enter leases into a system"

The report – Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures, developed by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) – has been developed to address the rising number of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks against the financial sector.
Benoît Cœuré, chairman of the CPMI, said “cyber resilience is a key priority for the financial industry” and called it a “landmark report”.
The aim of the guidelines is to help the financial markets industry respond to the risk of cyber crime in a internationally coordinated way, by pre-empting cyber attacks, responding rapidly and effectively to them, and achieving faster and safer target recovery objectives if the attacks succeed. It therefore provides authorities with a set of internationally agreed guidelines to support consistent and effective oversight and supervision of FMIs in the area of cyber risk.
Key concepts for tackling cyber crime
The guidelines include the following ideas and aims:

Sound cyber governance is key. Board and senior management attention is critical to a successful cyber resilience strategy.
The ability to resume operations quickly and safely after a successful cyber attack is paramount.
FMIs should make use of good-quality threat intelligence and rigorous testing.
FMIs should aim to instil a culture of cyber risk awareness and demonstrate ongoing re-evaluation and improvement of their cyber resilience at every level within the organisation.
Cyber resilience cannot be achieved by an FMI alone; it is a collective endeavour of the whole ""ecosystem"""

MAS announced the fifth phase of the project on 11 November 2019, following the successful development of a blockchain-based prototype for multi-currency payments.
The report, entitled 'Project Ubin Phase 5: Enabling Broad Ecosystem Opportunities', provides technical insights into the blockchain-based multi-currency payments network prototype that was built and describes how the network could benefit the financial industry and blockchain ecosystem.
“As with all innovation adoption, there is a time for experimentation, and a time for commercialisation,"" said Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer at MAS. ""Project Ubin has worked with the financial industry and blockchain community on a journey of experimentation, prototyping and learning. This has built a strong foundation of knowledge, expertise and experience, and paved a path towards commercial adoption. Following the successful experimentation over five phases, we look forward to greater adoption and live deployment of blockchain technology.”
Commercialisation of blockchain-based solutions
The report, which Accenture was commissioned to publish, examines the use of blockchain technology in commercial applications across different industries, and how these applications could benefit from integrating with the blockchain-based payments network prototype developed. MAS says these benefits were validated through workshops conducted with more than 40 financial and non-financial firms engaged in Phase 5 of Project Ubin.  
“Through Project Ubin, we have identified areas where blockchain-based solutions can be deployed at scale and drive greater payment efficiency across industries,"" said Lay Lim Teo, Accenture’s country managing director for Singapore. ""The financial ecosystem is an integral part of Singapore's ambition to be a Smart Nation.

Project Ubin Phase 5 validated the use of smart contracts on the payments network prototype in use cases such as delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement with assets on private exchanges, conditional payments and escrow for trade, as well as payment commitments for trade finance.
The commercial applications of the payments network prototype include cross-border payments in multiple currencies, foreign currency exchange, settlement of foreign currency denominated securities, as well as integration with other blockchain-based platforms to enable end-to-end digitalisation across many industries and use cases.

“Blockchain technology has great potential in transforming businesses and opening up new business opportunities,"" commented Chia Song Hwee, deputy chief executive officer at Temasek. ""Phase 5 of Project Ubin has demonstrated the commercial applicability, viability and benefits of blockchain technology across industries, beyond capital markets and trade finance.

AFP sent letters to the FED and the Department of the Treasury, voicing its support for the establishment of the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) and the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF). However, AFP also requested that the CPFF be extended to Tier 2 CP issuers, and that the MMLF include Tier 2 CP as eligible collateral.    
The Tier 2 CP market is approximately US$90bn in size and includes many public utilities and other critical industries. The AFP argues that extending the CPFF and MMLF to Tier 2 companies would not increase risk to the Federal Reserve by any measurable degree, as the historical default rate on 180-day P-2 paper is 0.027%, as compared to 0.018% for P-1 paper. 
At present, the Tier 2 CP market is largely frozen, with rates at two to three times their historical average. As a result, high-quality issuers will draw on their credit lines as an alternative source of liquidity, putting increased pressure on banks to find funding. By expanding the CPFF, the demand for bank credit on the part of Tier 2 issuers should decrease. Similarly, expanding the eligible collateral under the MMLF to include Tier 2 CP will help to restore demand and normalise rates on this high-quality paper.
“While some may be dismissive of the impact of higher funding rates on large corporations, it is important to understand the broader impact,” said Jim Kaitz, president and chief executive officer of AFP. “Higher funding costs may lead to headcount reductions, and delays or reductions in capital expenditures. Additionally, there will likely be negative impacts felt by businesses that supply Tier 2 CP issuers, as well as consumers.”"

This comes just days after the two largest banks in Argentina, Banco Galicia and Brubank, launched crypto trading, allowing their customers to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC) and Ripple (XRP). The BCRA said last Thursday that the move was to mitigate the risks that crypto poses to users and the entire financial system. Some of the risks include the high volatility of cryptos, their use for money laundering and their lack of regulatory protection. The decision to start crypto trading was initiated by a survey conducted by Banco Galicia, with 60% of respondents desiring access to digital currencies. Reports indicated that BCRA has been critical of cryptocurrencies for quite some time, warning the public about risks, such as volatility and money laundering, since May 2021, despite low levels of significant acceptance. According to Statista data analysis figures, 21% of respondents in Argentina had owned or used cryptocurrency in 2021, the sixth highest adoption rate in the world and the highest rate in the Americas. According to Argentina’s statistics agency, INDEC, Argentina's inflation rate rose another 6.7% in March 2022, the highest rate in 20 years, reaching 55.1% year-over-year growth. Some Argentinians looked to cryptocurrencies to hedge the rise in inflation. In April, rural towns began mining cryptocurrencies to combat inflation. The shift in focus from last May 2021 is reportedly related to the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) extended debt plan of US $44 billion, in efforts to deter Argentina from offering the use of cryptocurrencies. The BCRA's announcement is also inconsistent with the plans of the Mayor of Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina. Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta announced plans to digitize the city so that citizens could pay taxes in cryptocurrencies along with other blockchain plans in late April 2022"

The SBI Group commented that this type of remittance payment is becoming more popular as an alternative to traditional remittance methods. The group plans to increase the number of currencies that can be used for settlement in the future as demand for remittances using crypto assets continues to grow. The SBI Group further added that they will ensure measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, and carry out appropriate verification and monitoring of all involved parties. As one of the key partners of Ripple, jointly promoting the use of XRP in Asia, the SBI group continues to play a key role in expanding the usefulness of XRP, introducing payments in the altcoin and driving its adoption around the world, despite the ongoing SEC v. Ripple legal proceedings. Reports indicate that the SEC's stance is that XRP is an unregistered security. However, SBI Holdings disagrees and considers Ripple as a digital asset rather than a security when accepting XRP payments"

Last week, global increases in borrowing costs were instituted in efforts to curb inflation, including an accelerated move of 0.5 points by the US Federal Reserve Board, the Bank of England's fourth consecutive rate hike, and Australia’s and Sweden’s Riksbank’s unexpected raise. However, Frankfurt authorities are not planning to make a move yet. With the exception of the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, both facing much weaker inflation, the eurozone is now the only jurisdiction not raising interest rates. Agnes Belaisch, Chief European Strategist, Baring Investment Services Limited, commented that the ECB does not need to go as far as their counterparts. Belaisch stated that the Russia/Ukraine conflict is slowing the economy, and some companies are cutting production due to rising energy prices, showing that ECB tightening has already resulted in a slowdown. Reports indicate that this is a steady stance adopted by eurozone policy makers, and financial markets predict a rate movement to be months away. However, Bloomberg economists state that stronger inflation and an aggressive shift among ECB policymakers could indicate interest rates rising in September instead of December. Additionally monetary tightening aimed at controlling inflation will curb growth that is already weakened, economists added. The ECB policy makers stated that their defensive stance is based on the fact that the 19-nation eurozone economy is different from their global counterparts. Christine Lagarde, President, ECB, commented that both the United States and Europe are facing rising prices, but are also faced with unique circumstances. Reports indicate that inflation in the UK, unlike the US, is primarily driven by supply-side shocks, and the fiscal stimulus is in position to offset cost pressures on consumers. Labour market stagnation is higher, potential growth is lower, and the conflict in Ukraine poses greater risk to the outlook in the UK. Economists also predict ECB will lower their record low deposit rate of 0.5% to zero"

Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly released the long-awaited framework for the update of the 1977 Act, which takes into account the emergence of mobile/online banking as well as accurately defining the activities that would qualify for CRA credit. Regulators who approved the proposed rulemaking stated that the new rule would be stricter. Martin Gruenberg, deputy director, FDIC, said the new rule would raise the bar for retail lenders to achieve highly satisfactory ratings. Furthermore, Rohit Chopra, Director of the Consumer Finance Protection Agency, Lael Brainard, Vice-Chair, Federal Reserve Board, and Martin Grünberg, Vice-Chair, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, issued a joint proposal on ordinances to update the implementation rules for the CRA. Under this proposal, the regulatory agencies stated that they will continue to use the facility-based assessment scope as a key factor in determining whether a bank is in compliance with CRA obligations. Additionally, the new proposed rule advises large banks to assess areas where their retail lending is heavily concentrated, as well as aggregate activity in low- and moderate-income areas across the country. Regulators will also request that large banks include community development activities, regardless of location, to be described as a separate metric indicator"

The index found that Italy is the most complex jurisdiction in Europe and is also the world's most complex jurisdiction for tax, while Greece has the world's most complex compliance environment. The index ranks 94 jurisdictions, grouping them within three key areas of challenge: regulation, knowledge and technology.
The Cayman Islands, along with Jersey, Hong Kong and the UAE, are considered to be the least complex places for compliance from an accounting and tax perspective.
Extremely complex
Commenting on the findings, TMF Group’s Juraj Gerzeni said: “Despite measures to reduce taxation and align Italian accounting measures with international rules, the country still has some very specific requirements that contribute to its index ranking. Greece meanwhile has an extremely complex set of tax rules that directly impact local accounting. Organisations can find it very difficult to navigate the many accounting and tax requirements in Italy and Greece. In order to remain compliant and reach their full business potential in these markets, it’s necessary to work with in-country professionals that possess the required level of local expertise.”
Unintentional non-compliance
The TMF Group outlined some of the issues that make tax and compliance difficult in Italy and Greece:

Taxation in Italy is levied at national, regional and municipal levels, with numerous requirements for reports and returns to be submitted.
The compliance burden has increased recently because Italy is addressing its problem of VAT evasion and is also seeking to comply with the Base erosion and profit-shifting (BEPS) initiative.
Italy's tax system is complex and time-consuming for businesses.
In Greece, there are several layers of VAT and no consistency in the application of the tax.
Due to the volume and the complexity of Greek tax legislation, it is very common for a taxpayer to be in breach of some tax provision, even unintentionally"

LexisNexis® Risk Solutions, a global provider of information and analytics for businesses across industries, forecasts a substantial surge in BNPL transactions, particularly this Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and cautions of heightened fraud potential. Online shopping has significantly increased due to the pandemic, resulting in an increase of BNPL transactions by 182%, from June 2020 to June 2021, according to the LexisNexis Risk Solutions Cybercrime Report H1, 2021. The main risk is that fraudsters can open new accounts with credentials stolen from trusted customers. Fraudulent activities, such as associating email addresses or mobile numbers with a given applicant, are not likely to be detected because BNPL providers usually execute ""soft"" credit or identity checks. In order to identify and prevent these types of fraudulent activities, BNPL providers and retailers must equip themselves with a defense system to confirm instantaneous validity during the application process. Additional risk is posed where the fraudster has taken over the account and is able to make purchases from the stolen credentials of the existing BNPL user. According to LexisNexis, adding layers to the verification process and using a mix of physical and digital characteristics to verify a person’s identity can substantially reduce fraud risk for payment providers and retailers. Merchants can minimize point-of-sale (POS) scams and chargebacks by carrying out an identity and fraud verification process on the front-end. Internet robotic (Bot) attacks have increased 41%, while human initiated attacks fell 29% (June 2020-June 2021), according to a recent cybercrime report. More details can be found at Cybercrime Report | LexisNexis Risk Solutions. Digital fraud continues to be on the rise where fraudsters are keen to utilize dark web intelligence, sophisticated automated tools, and organized networks spread throughout industries and borders to conduct fraudulent activities. With the constant evolution and flexibility of emerging payments and e-commerce, both payment providers and retailers must take precautionary steps to install defense mechanisms into their current processes to ensure consumers and businesses are protected from potential fraud risk. Technologies should be able to decipher between a trusted consumer and a fraudulent one in a seamless transactional way"

What are the latest developments and what will the role of corporate treasury be in planning for changes to corporate tax strategy?
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has now released all the key instruments needed for its BEPS initiative (namely: the BEPS reports, Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the Multilateral Instrument/MLI) and two-thirds of companies are already actively preparing to comply, according to a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters last August. Now that the EU and other countries are legislating and providing more clarity on how they will implement BEPS, it's a good time for companies to take stock and consider how their operations and tax strategy might change.
Latest BEPS developments
A 2016 year-end review by EY points out some of the most recent developments:

In October 2016, the European Commission announced a new package of corporate tax reforms, which included the common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB), a directive on double taxation dispute resolution mechanisms and amendments to the anti-tax avoidance directive (ATAD).
As of the beginning of 2017, nearly 100 countries have committed to the implementation of BEPS through their membership of the Inclusive Framework on BEPS Implementation. Many countries have begun to implement some of the recommendations made in the BEPS report.
In November 2016, the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) was published – an instrument that changes the way bilateral tax treaties are updated and facilitate the implementation of BEPS changes into treaties as quickly as possible. (Of the 15 action points initially proposed to establish a BEPS framework, the MLI was the last point – see the graph below showing all 15 actions based around three pillars of coherence, substance and transparency).

15 actions for BEPS

Corporate treasury will play key role in identifying income
According to EY's Zachary John, writing in Treasury&Risk, the BEPS project is now setting recommended minimum standards for these 15 actions and has completed standards for actions 5, 6, 13 and 14.
Some of the BEPS actions will mean that multinationals have to seriously rethink their organisational and fiscal structures and action 13 – re-examine transfer pricing documentation and country-by-country reporting – will in particular require expertise from corporate treasury"

EY's John writes: “. as country-by-country reporting is adopted in participating countries, corporate treasurers will have to assist the tax function in identifying income, whether through the implementation or modification of technology or redesign of a process that may not capture the level of detail required.”
John adds: “Tax departments should consider a change in how they report income in all the affected tax jurisdictions, and they will likely lean on treasury to supply income and revenue information by country, as well as information about any applicable transfer pricing.”

The deal is designed to expand the bank’s digital payment capabilities and see the platform extended and accessible to the broader auto industry for the first time. Over time, the alliance between the two firms will seek to develop the platform for new markets and industries outside of the automotive sector where mobility-focused payments will become central. Volkswagen Financial Services will remain a shareholder and the platform will continue to facilitate payments across the Volkswagen network in support of all Volkswagen Group brands globally.
Business alignment
Founded in 2017 in Luxembourg, Volkswagen Payments S.A. operates a payments platform designed for the auto industry. Operating in 32 markets around the world, the business offers a range of digital payments services across the auto ecosystem including initial purchase and leasing, in-vehicle payments, fuelling and electric vehicle charging, parking and subscription-based services such as insurance and in-vehicle entertainment. It focuses on digitally connecting the auto ecosystem and improving the payments experience for consumers, distributors and suppliers alike.
The bank says that the platform is a natural fit for J.P. Morgan’s Wholesale Payments business - which combines corporate treasury services, trade finance, card and merchant services capabilities - and delivers an integrated payments experience to end users across the economy. Volkswagen Payments S.A. will continue to be based in Luxembourg, also one of J.P. Morgan’s key European locations and where it has supported clients for more than 45 years.
Promoting seamless payment experiences

use on-line payment systems so that customers can pay at any time, whenever they want
rank salesmen/women and sales offices as to their success in credit management, and publish the results to drive improvement
group and report your disputes by age, e.g. Green - 1 month, Amber - 2months, Red - 3 months, with the aim of Credit Policy allowing the Credit team to take control in month 4 to credit the customer if still not resolved.

This partnership will enable partner merchants to accept card-free payments, and customers will be able to pay directly from their bank account using the merchant app. Transactions will be processed through the automated clearing house (ACH) network. Discover’s integration will benefit its merchants by reducing reliance on card, saving them interchange fees (the fee network charges merchants for accepting card payments). In turn, the savings can be passed down to customers in the form of discounts, encouraging repeat purchases, and closer merchant relationships. Additionally, Discover will use this integration to improve its position as a payment provider. Some of the benefits are increased use of the ACH network powering A2A transactions and increased opportunities for B2B payments and healthcare transactions. The amount of ACH increased by 8.7% in 2021 compared to 2020 (Figure 1: Nacha chart below). Bank of America’s Pay by Bank service will enable e-commerce retailers in the UK to accept account-to-account (A2A) payments. The customer chooses Pay by Bank at checkout and selects the bank from the menu. Per the press release, this feature is not exclusive to Bank of America customers, and transactions are authenticated in open banking. Bank of America plans to introduce Pay by Bank to additional markets globally, and the United States may soon consider the issuer’s large domestic footprint in the country. Additionally, Bank of America can deepen its ties to open banking where fintechs such as Plaid and Mastercard’s Finicity are rapidly gaining ground.

7760,3351,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/uk-companies-face-increasing-pensions-deficit-burden,UK companies face increasing pensions deficit burden,2017-09-08,,"Yesterday British Airways announced it might close its main defined-benefit (DB) pension scheme – at a time when UK companies face an increase in total pensions deficit. This BBC news report said the airline's proposal is meant to tackle its “significant and growing funding deficit” and if the move goes ahead, employees will no longer be able to make further payments into its NARP pension scheme, which currently has about 17,000 members. In March 2017, BA's pension scheme deficit stood at £3.7 billion – making it “the largest of all UK company pension deficits relative to the company's overall financial value”, according to the company.
Huge pensions deficit
This news comes just as a report by Barnett Waddingham, an actuarial firm, highlights the growing pensions deficit for the UK's biggest corporates. Last year, the total pensions deficit for companies in the FTSE350 increased from £50 billion to £62 billion. The report says 2016 was a “particularly volatile” year for DB pension schemes run by the UK's biggest companies.
The report also found an increase in benefit payments from FTSE350 companies of around 15 per cent last year, which it attributes to an increase in transfer value payments to defined contribution (DC) schemes.
Sterling tumbles and longevity stalls
However, there were some positive indicators too. After the EU referendum in June 2016, the value of sterling tumbled, significantly reducing the deficit contributions as a proportion of free cash flow – from 9 per cent in 2015 to 5 per cent in 2016, according to the study. Barnett Waddingham concluded that a number of companies with overseas operations benefitted from the post-referendum fall in the value of sterling.
And on a more macabre note, the report found that mortality in the UK had eased off over the past five years. The plateau in the trend towards living longer could provide some welcome respite for companies from a DB pension scheme funding perspective, said the report. It stated: “Data confirming this was only released in the last few months, but if this trend had been recognised in the 2016 financial statements of the FTSE350 companies, this would have reduced the aggregate deficit by around £10bn.”
Flight from defined-benefit
In any case, the report by Barnett Waddingham shows BA is not alone in taking steps to end its DB pension scheme"

In any case, the report by Barnett Waddingham shows BA is not alone in taking steps to end its DB pension scheme. It found that 150 of the companies in its study were still offering a DB pension to current employees in 2016 – but it adds: “the closure of these schemes continues apace, with some high-profile companies terminating DB pension accrual over the year”"
7762,3352,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/uk-businesses-report-corners-cut-on-supplier-vetting-and-onboarding,UK businesses report corners cut on supplier vetting and onboarding,2019-10-25,,"Policies designed to vet suppliers and vendors against indicators of bribery and corruption are poorly understood and inconsistently applied, according to research from Dow Jones Risk & Compliance into the third-party risk management practices of UK companies. The research, conducted in August 2019, surveyed 250 UK-based procurement professionals from five sectors: engineering and construction, oil and gas, IT and technology, media and telecoms, and manufacturing.
Some of the key findings from the research include:

31% of the third parties that businesses work with are considered ‘high risk’.
50% say that the time required to vet suppliers results in corners being cut to do business faster.
A third of all new supplier onboarding undertaken in the past 12 months was likely to have been executed incorrectly.
Over half of procurement professionals are not confident that existing suppliers have been vetted properly.
41% say senior-level relationships influence the level of supplier vetting.
Less than half (45%) have regular and training certification programmes to ensure the code of conduct for third-party risk management is fully understood and applied.

With the promise of increased scrutiny from regulators, and stronger enforcement from prosecutors such as the Serious Fraud Office, change is needed - and quickly - if UK companies are to avoid disruption, financial penalties and reputational damage. A third of all new supplier onboarding undertaken in the past 12 months was likely to have been executed incorrectly, while more than 50% of the procurement professionals surveyed said they were not confident that existing suppliers had been vetted properly. 
The research shows that procurement professionals expect a doubling of third-party relationships in the next three years, despite the challenges already faced in managing 2019 volumes. Two-fifths say that their approach needs an overhaul, but the majority do not expect to see an increase in budgets to prepare for future requirements. Half expect budgets for third-party vendor management to stay the same, while a quarter forecast their budget will be cut. 
“This research reveals significant gaps in the implementation of third-party risk management processes, as well as a lack of business-wide understanding about the risks such processes are designed to address,"" said Guy Harrison, general manager of Dow Jones Risk & Compliance. ""With enforcement action on the rise, compliance simply isn’t the place to cut corners. UK businesses need to address blind spots around third-party risk management as a matter of urgency"

“This survey suggests that compliance officers need to have visibility over the entire third party onboarding process,"" commented Jim Lord, former US Department of Justice prosecutor and consultant to Dow Jones Risk & Compliance. ""A consistent risk-based approach implemented throughout the organisation with oversight from compliance is a critical component of having ‘adequate procedures’ in place.” 
“UK businesses are much less likely to be caught up in bribery overseas than they were ten years ago,"" added Charles Monteith, former head of Assurance for the Serious Fraud Office. ""This is thanks to both the threat of prosecution and the stipulations of the UK Bribery Act. The demand side is also changing. Driven by the need to have anti-corruption laws of equal standing, and to protect domestic industry, other countries have instated tougher laws - although they haven’t entirely caught up with the UK. Overall, there is a sense amongst business that bribery is neither sustainable or worth the risk.”"

These are some of the warning voices coming from British industry associations.
Britain's corporate and banking sector is “close to their point-of-no-return” a UK business lobby group warned this week, after it became clear that Theresa May's government still doesn't have a clear strategy for Brexit. The warning was reported by Bloomberg, quoting a speech due to be given by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) president Paul Drechsler. In his speech he is to say: “Every day, companies are having to plan for the worst while hoping for the best. They are making choices that will determine new jobs, new plants and new investments in the years ahead. Businesses will press snooze for as long as they can – but the alarm will go off.”
'Act of gross irresponsibility to walk away'
This warning came after Brexit negotiations stalled this week over the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with the DUP vetoing the idea of Northern Ireland being the only part of the UK to remain in the Single Market and the Customs Union. Following that, the British government's department for leaving the European Union (DexEU) also faced embarrassment as Brexit minister David Davis told a parliamentary committee that his department has not carried out detailed sectoral analysis of the impact of Brexit (contradicting his previous claim that in-depth research had been done for 58 sectors).
A survey by the CBI suggests that about one in 10 companies have started preparing for a 'no-deal scenario' on Brexit, a proportion that will rise to six out of 10 by March 2018. However, Drechsler had stern words those who are urging the prime minister to walk away from negotiations in favour of a 'no-deal' Brexit. He said this would almost certainly mean job losses in British industry: “We can’t enter into negotiations that affect the future of millions of people and then leave at the first sign of trouble. It would be an act of gross irresponsibility to walk away"

It would be an act of gross irresponsibility to walk away.”
Urgent call to protect EU-UK data flows
UK Finance, the association for the financial, banking and payments industry, also called for rapid action to protect flows of data between the EU and UK post Brexit. A joint report commissioned by UK Finance and TechUK said mutual agreements on the treatment of data exchanged between the UK and the EU, plus a transition period, would be needed to preserve the strong working relationships already in place and offer businesses much-needed regulatory certainty.
UK Finance stated: “When the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, it will lose the automatic legal framework for the free flow of personal data. Unless a new arrangement is agreed, transfers of personal data across Europe will be severely limited – requiring alternative mechanisms which can be costly or complex – or stop, potentially at huge financial cost for both economies. It is in the interests of both the UK and EU27 to act on this issue as soon as possible.”
Time is of the essence
TechUK's CEO, Julian David, said: “We are a data-driven economy and our success is underpinned by our ability to move that data cross-border. With the Brexit deadline growing ever closer, time is of the essence. The UK and EU must recognise each other’s data protection frameworks as adequate as soon as possible. This should be a priority for Phase Two of Brexit negotiations. This isn’t solely for the benefit of one industry or one country but for the whole European economy as cross-border data flows become ever more important for trade and the ability to do businesses.”

CTMfile take: The state of Brexit negotiations at the current moment is bewildering. As a corporate treasurer, CFO or other financial professional, how are you now planning your operations post March 2019? How would you like to see the UK-EU negotiations conclude and what scenario would be the best deal for your company?"

Globally, there are now an average of 103 daily alerts.Global growth of regulatory announcementsSource & Copyright©2014 - Thomson Reuters Currently, the majority of the activity is coming from UK/Europe and North America, so the situation is probably going to get worse, as the other regions implement the current regulations and develop their own regulations as well. Thomson Reuters also found that the costs, and the consequences of non-compliance are rising. How to manage the GRC burdenWhat corporate treasury departments need to manage their growing compliance burden is: to be kept up-to-date on the regulatory changes AND what to do about them to understand their GRC risk across the whole company systems, processes and workflows to help them manage their compliance burden.Then, and only then, can they turn compliance into an opportunity for improved processes, cost savings and reduced risk.Thomson Reuters have developed a unique approach to Governance, Risk and Compliance: keeping clients up-to-date on what is happening in each of the regulatory areas providing a single view of risk across the enterprise bridging together all the complex data from around the world using standard GRC workflow processes.This approach, they claim, turns risk into an opportunity, enables clients to make better informed decisions faster, and mitigates enforcement and reputational damage, as well as optimising the resources and personnel required.———* Users include over 60 of the Fortune Global 100, 49 of the world’s top 50 banks and over 300 enforcement and regulatory agencies.CTMfile take: It is vital for corporate treasury departments to turn the compliance burden into an opportunity for risk reduction, and cost reduction/control as the use of Bloomberg’s MARS investment analysis package showed. The use of third party services, such as Thomson Reuters’s GRC support services, will have to grow as the compliance burden is increasing and corporate treasury departments’ budgets are not being increased in line with the growing burden"

Even so, the starting point for minimising your cybersecurity risk has to be understanding of the basic metrics of how good or bad your security systems and processes really are.

• external threats by tracking the number of:

botnet infections per device

properly configured SSL certificates 

• insider threats by tracking:

amount of peer-to-peer file-sharing activity on a company’s corporate network
% of of employees with “super user” access
average number of days between notification of job departure and elimination of corporate access
frequency by which employee access is reassessed

• supply chain threats by tracking:

number of open ports during a period of time
percentage of third-party software that has been scanned for vulnerabilities prior to deployment
frequency by which a company reviews its entire list of suppliers and vendors and designates those that are critical
frequency by which a company verifies its vendor’s controls
percentage of critical vendors whose cybersecurity effectiveness is continuously monitored.

Operating a cybersecurity management programme
To operate a cost effective, practical cybersecurity programme, for themselves and their vendors companies need to:

live by the motto that, as BITsight put it, “There is no guaranteed security, only less risk.”
accept that the cybersecurity risks needs to be monitored and managed in both your organisation AND your vendors
continously monitor and manage these 12 cybersecurity metrics (in real-time if possible).

He wrote “It’s a simple question: what is the purpose of a bank? However, the answers I get are often missing the mark, imho. I get answers like to fund business, to finance progress, to support the government, to keep economies stable, to manage risk, to build communities, to allow people to be secure, to enable trade and more. These answers are all true but, for me, the heart of banking’s purpose is to make societies better.”
This is heavy philosophical stuff, but it matters as the global economy moves into survival mode and as companies really need to focus on sustainable operation, e.g. Microsoft has set themselves a target of getting rid of their whole CO2 impact since they were founded in 1975.
Corporate treasury department objectives and mission
Martin Lewis, the UK consumers’ adviser on all things financial, advises money mantras to help people control/rationalise their spending:

Corporate treasury is not quite that simple, but most corporate treasury departments have a clear view of their objectives/mission of what they do, for example:

ensure liquidity to fund operations and provide stewardship over the global capital structure
manage a portfolio of financial risks and provide services to minimize exposure to certain financial and operational loss
provide professional stewardship of financial assets to manage risk and return within approved parameters
provide a low cost, high-quality global transaction processing platform and enterprise solutions that support business profitability.

Other corporate treasury departments talk about the need to:

provide financial risk management and stewardship over financial assets and liabilities to enable the corporation to achieve its Objectives/Mission
identify, monitor and manage our financial risks and to seek to protect its profits, cash flows and assets.

Corporate treasury department purpose
But what is the purpose of a corporate treasury department? Does a corporate treasury department really have a purpose?

7771,3358,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/3-critical-stages-for-implementing-financial-automation,3 critical stages for implementing financial automation,2018-11-19,,"Robotic process automation (RPA) promises to speed up and automate financial processes while reducing errors and will be commonplace in finance departments by 2020, according to Gartner. But implementations are likely to encounter failures at three key stages: during planning, during the implementation and during testing.
Gartner's head of finance research, Johanna Robinson, said: “To deploy RPA successfully finance leaders must embrace a new mindset. Unless finance departments take a more agile approach when implementing RPA, they are likely to experience failures at each phase of implementation and won’t realize the full potential of the technology.”
Planning
During the planning stage, it's important to focus on automating a single activity, rather than trying to tackle an end-to-end process. Robinson said: “Finance departments can start relatively conservatively with RPA by focusing on using one bot against a number of individual activities.”
According to Gartner, this is because the code for one automated activity can then be applied more easily to other similar activities within the same or different processes. It says that companies can therefore benefit quickly from RPA, without investing a lot of time planning, standardising and implementing.
Building
An RPA deployment shouldn't be approached in the same way as a traditional technology implementation, where a 'big bang' approach is often used. According to Gartner's Robinson, an incremental approach is better: “You don’t need to figure out every possible use case and requirement of an RPA solution before you begin. This will just result in spending more time and money than is really needed.”
Testing
According to Gartner, RPA leaders should determine and manage what support is needed from IT and vendors, rather than the other way around. It states: “Relying too much on IT teams and vendors to identify the issues and needs for deploying robots often causes failures in the testing stage.”
Robinson adds: “The benefits of successful RPA deployments within finance include a reduction in errors from manual work and a redeployment of full-time employees to higher value activities. But robots are only as good as the people who design and manage them. CFOs should start any RPA deployment by ensuring they understand the new agile mindset needed to implement the technology, with the right competencies in place to manage it.”"

The amount stolen increased by nearly one billion dollars to $16 billion.
The graph below shows how the number of victims of identify fraud in the US has increased by one-third since 2011, while the amount criminals stole through ID fraud in 2016 has decreased since 2011, it is still $1 billion more than in 2015.

The report picked out four significant trends:

There were a record number of US citizens affected by ID fraud in 2016. Last year, 6.15 per cent of consumers became victims of identity fraud. This is the highest incidence since Javelin began tracking identity fraud.
Card-not-present (CNP) fraud increased by 40 per cent, driven by the growth of e- and m-commerce.
Account takeover losses reached $2.3 billion, a 61 per cent increase on 2015, while incidence rose 31 per cent.
New-account fraud continues unabated. Fraudsters have become better at evading detection and victims are likely to discover fraud through review of their credit report (15 per cent) or when they were contacted by a debt collector (13 per cent).

The new service will enable clients of both entities to send real-time payments in the US through The Clearing House’s (TCH) RTP network.
“Kyriba’s vision to broaden the payment choices available to corporate chief financial officers (CFOs) and treasurers aligns with JP Morgan’s open banking initiatives,” said Sairam Rangachari, global head of open banking at JP Morgan.
“Our clients value the option to transmit real-time payments, and the API integration we have implemented with Kyriba enables these payments to be processed and confirmed within seconds. Together we have launched the next generation of payments technology to truly modernise the payments experience for our joint clients.”
The two entities describe RTP as “a game changer” for many corporate finance teams who require more choices in how they send payments.
“In addition to the faster payment transmission and acknowledgement, real-time payments on TCH’s RTP network can be sent on-demand, simplifying the reconciliation and back office application of payments as compared to managing batch files,” they add.
“Our API integration with JP Morgan means Kyriba is the first treasury management provider and first payments hub solution to offer real-time payments to JP Morgan corporate customers,” said Bob Stark, vice president of strategy for Kyriba.
“The speed and frictionless experience that the integration with JP Morgan offers is a breakthrough for our clients who want to extend real-time payment automation to their enterprise resource planning (ERP) and treasury systems.”

Security in the API platform is managed through tokenised authentication methodology and data exchanged through its APIs are encrypted. 
MoolahGo says that the API is for businesses looking to automate their payments processes. By using the API connectivity, businesses can send payment instructions directly from their systems, which can reduce the workload of finance and accounting staff. Automation also increases speed while reducing or eliminating payment errors typically associated with manual data entry. 
MoolahGo also makes its APIs available to any partners that wish to enhance their service offerings and to generate additional revenue opportunities by embedding MoolahGo’s cross-border payment solution into their platforms. 
“As a fintech company, we aim not only to make financial transactions faster, cheaper and better for our customers, we also strive to make financial services easily accessible through a wide channel network,” said John Hakim, CEO of MoolahGo"

These can completely change your life for the worse if they had gotten into the wrong hands.
An average person spends about 11 hours online each day. They chat with their friends, email their colleagues, play games, watch movies, or just catch up with their Facebook friends every day. And each time they open a website, they log in to their accounts, making their presence known to other people online.
If you think your password—which is probably the name of your pet, your birth date or your children’s names—is safe from prying eyes, think again. Most people don’t use a secure password, which makes them vulnerable to hacking. And when hackers are able to infiltrate one of your accounts, they may infiltrate all of them, including your online bank accounts and personal records.
And they can do all that by manually guessing your password or using automated programs to guess it. There are other ways of discovering a user’s password, but all these can be prevented, or at least slowed down considerably, by using a strong password. A strong password is your protection online.

Eric Cohen and Chis Lee writing in TREASURY & RISK, point out that the failure rate (of M&A deals) is high, some studies estimates at more than 60 percent. This is they add, ‘largely because they focus on a deal’s synergies without adequately considering how they are going to identify, assess, and mitigate operational and organisational risks. In the recent PWC Survey, executives planning to undertake a strategic transaction cited “creating and capitalising on deal synergies” as the primary driver of their M&A aspirations.’ They then ask, ‘How can your organizsation beat the odds and successfully navigate a complex merger, acquisition, spinoff, or carve-out to increase profitability, market share, and shareholder value? One key driver of M&A success—from initial scoping through transaction close and beyond—is the performance of the treasury function. Due to its financial importance, operational significance, and organisational complexity, corporate treasury often serves as the bellwether of a deal’s success. It’s critical for a treasury function to manage the risks inherent in a large-scale transaction, while capitalising on the opportunities to strategically transform the newly formed organisation.’Once the deal is signed and prior to close Cohen and Lee, suggest that: ‘the treasury function should: form a strategic vision create a detailed transition plank with prioritised tasks create a transition services agreement form a dedicated tradition team interface with key stakeholders early and often project-manage progress and dependencies describe the day-one operating environment  communicate with all employees.’And then lay the foundation for the treasury team.Read more in the full article - recommended - here"
7778,3365,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/4-ways-to-make-zero-based-budgeting-a-success-for-your-firm,4 ways to make zero-based budgeting a success for your firm,2019-01-07,,"Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a technique that's been around for decades but remains fairly unpopular with many business managers, partly due to the workload involved in providing regular, detailed reporting on spending needs within each business unit to justify the funds allocated each year. But with the move to digital budgeting processes and increasing recognition of the efficiency benefits of this method from the c-suite, many CFOs are considering how ZBB could be used effectively. This interview with McKinsey partner Wigbert Böhm highlights some of the strategies that contribute to the success of a ZBB approach across the organisation. Here are four of the key strategies discussed in the interview:
Appoint cost-category owners
Organisations already have budget owners for each division but they should also appoint employees (typically senior leaders) to act as cost-category owners (CCOs), to vet budget requests for spending categories that appear across all business units. Böhm gives the example of property rental or security spending – in other words, a type of expenditure that recurs in different areas of the organisation. A large corporate might expect to have between 12-15 COOs. Böhm says: “The very existence of this role can change the tenor and content of budgeting discussions. Rather than assume that funding levels should remain the same, the CCO asks the budget owners from the business units, 'Why is this the case, and does it need to be this way?'”
Revamp your data
Implementing a ZBB approach involves a rigorous process of going through existing financial data sets and systems across the company. Böhm cites a large European utility that was able to save $150 million from its baseline spending of about $900 million, after using this process to find duplicate spending in some of its units. He says that the discussions between budget owners and CCOs at the utility firm, and the broader assessment process, from start to finish, took about eight months although he adds the process could take more like eight weeks for a smaller private company.
Choose where ZBB will be effective
If you're attracted to the idea of implementing a ZBB approach in your organisation, ask yourself if this needs to be done throughout the company or whether it would be most effective in a select number of divisions or even across one region. Your company's specific business needs will dictate where ZBB will be most useful"

If you're attracted to the idea of implementing a ZBB approach in your organisation, ask yourself if this needs to be done throughout the company or whether it would be most effective in a select number of divisions or even across one region. Your company's specific business needs will dictate where ZBB will be most useful. Böhm gives the example of a multinational food company that chose to roll out ZBB only in business units that had previously not been integrated with the organisation. He says: “This was part of the company’s objective in using ZBB – making sure that the different business units in each country cooperate more, reduce duplicate spending, and exploit basic cost-savings opportunities, such as merging their logistics networks or rationalizing their supplier base. Another firm might find that deploying ZBB in only one region or one business unit suits its needs.”
CFO support is essential
Böhm notes that: “If the CFO doesn’t support the process, the whole thing is over. The CFO must be the evangelist for ZBB.” And this support also has to come from other c-suite leaders, adds Böhm. CFOs need to convince other c-suite executive and board members that ZBB brings operational efficiencies and performance benefits, evidenced by tangible examples of success. Böhm says that CFOs should show “how people have been able to work more efficiently because of smarter resource utilization, for instance. This whole process, after all, is about improving resource allocation and ensuring that money is being spent in a meaningful way, not in a wasteful way.”"
7780,3366,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/dbs-launches-online-tracking-for-cross-border-collections,DBS launches online tracking for cross-border collections,2020-10-23,,"DBS Bank says it is the first bank in Asia to launch real-time online tracking of cross-border collections for its corporate clients. Powered by SWIFT gpi, more than 240,000 DBS corporate and SME clients in Singapore and Hong Kong will be the first to benefit from real-time, online tracking of their cross-border payments and collections, for no additional fee.
Raof Latiff, group head of Digital for Institutional Banking at DBS Bank, said that the bank has accelerated its multi-year digital roadmap in just a few months to provide greater support to its corporate clients to ensure they emerge strong from these challenging times. 
“The importance of enabling real-time tracking of cross-border payments and collections amid the landscape we operate in today cannot be underplayed as it helps businesses improve their working capital management and fosters trust with overseas counterparties"" Latiff said. ""This in turn helps improve supply chain efficiencies and encourages economic growth, enabling countries to bounce back faster from the pandemic.” 
DBS’ market share of SWIFT cross-border payments across its core markets increased by 4% year-on-year. The bank puts this down to the relevance of its digital solutions in helping businesses facilitate cross-border transactions swiftly and cost-efficiently even amid global disruptions.
“Our ethos at SWIFT is simple,"" commented Eddie Haddad, managing director, Asia Pacific at SWIFT. ""In keeping with our vision of minimising friction for the ecosystem, optimising speed and ensuring integrity in cross-border transactions, we remain focused on accelerating growth in international payments. Recent developments in technology and a shift in customer expectations have led to disruption in the world we operate in. So now, more than ever, there is a need for the financial services community to band together to help corporates navigate the complexities and challenges of today’s business landscape. With the new online inbound gpi capability, corporates will gain the real-time visibility needed to give them more control of their entire payment flows.” 
Helping corporates enhance working capital efficiencies 
Traditionally, the tracking of cross-border collections tends to be highly manual, whereby corporates often rely on a copy of SWIFT message from the remitter, which confirms their remittance instruction has been processed by their bank"

Helping corporates enhance working capital efficiencies 
Traditionally, the tracking of cross-border collections tends to be highly manual, whereby corporates often rely on a copy of SWIFT message from the remitter, which confirms their remittance instruction has been processed by their bank. For interim status-updates, corporates have to depend on their bank or the remitter (via the remitter’s bank) to find out the latest status of the transfer across multiple banks, a process which is tedious, costly and time-consuming.
With the DBS SWIFT gpi solution, all corporates need to do is to log into the bank’s online corporate banking portal, DBS IDEAL, to receive instant updates on where the incoming funds are in the cross-border payment chain.
In markets where regulations require additional information or supporting documents for cross-border transfers, corporates can use DBS DigiDocs to transmit information and supporting documents digitally and instantly. This end-to-end digital solution significantly reduces the need for paper-intensive processes. The bank says that this solution is currently available in China, India, Vietnam, and is expected to be launched in Indonesia and Taiwan over the next few months.
With real-time visibility to incoming cash flows, corporates are able to optimise their working capital management and utilise their cash more effectively. In addition, businesses can fulfil their commercial obligations quicker by releasing goods upon the receipt of payment from the overseas counterparty, optimising inventory and cash cycles and building more efficient supply chains. 
Makino Asia, a machine tool manufacturer, sees value in the SWIFT gpi solution in helping the firm optimise their working capital management. “Cash flow is the lifeblood of all businesses and having instant notifications on the status of incoming payments, in addition to outward payments, is important in helping us manage our cash in a manner that would unlock strategic value for our business,” said S Janarthana, deputy general manager of Makino Asia.
The relevance of the solution is also echoed by one of the world’s largest independent commodities trading houses, Gunvor Group"

The relevance of the solution is also echoed by one of the world’s largest independent commodities trading houses, Gunvor Group. “Having the ability to access real-time status updates on all inward cross-border collections across our businesses in multiple geographies radically reduces the amount of time and manpower hours to reconcile incoming payments with invoices,"" said Cheryl Cheong, treasury manager, Asia-Pacific at Gunvor Group. ""DBS has taken a transformative approach to digitalise its clients’ cash management experience and support treasury division’s goal towards improved working capital management.”
Likewise, for fashion e-commerce startup Zilingo, the Singapore-headquartered group shared that the solution is particularly beneficial to their business. “With real-time tracking capabilities, we have full visibility on the status of incoming payments giving us greater certainty, enabling us to ship our fashion and lifestyle products out to our customers even faster and pay our suppliers quicker, delivering a transformed experience to all our partners in our ecosystem,” said Venkata Narayana D, the startup's group finance director.
""With the convenience of being able to track our incoming funds instantly through DBS’ corporate banking portal, we have seen a significant decline in call volumes made by our operations team to track the latest status of transfers,"" commented Allen Wang, director of Operations of Maike Group (Triway International Limited/ Matrix Metal Resources), one of China’s largest corporations engaging in the trading of non-ferrous metals. ""This allows our employees to focus on higher value tasks to unlock even greater value for our customers.”

He said: “In short, while I can very well envisage a world without cash, I view it as the outcome of changing technologies and social perceptions, not of policy prescriptions.”He added that it would not be desirable to remove the lower bound in the euro area at the current juncture, for the following three reasons: It would not solve all problems related to monetary policy. “The experience of the global financial crisis taught us that the type of shocks which can drive policy interest rates to the lower bound are also shocks which produce severe impairments to the monetary policy transmission mechanism,” said Cœuré. Persistently low interest rates pose a risk to financial stability. Cœuré explained: “We are prepared to use our micro- and macro-prudential instruments to face the risks of bubbles and excessive leverage, but if the lower bound were effectively abolished, those risks would increase and may lead to macroeconomic instability along this dynamically inefficient path.” There could also be economic or demographic reasons for the lower bound rate. “An important issue here is the possibility that the natural real rate may have fallen very low or even gone negative; this could occur for various reasons such as low productivity or a slowdown in population growth, both of which are relevant for the euro area,” noted Cœuré.In response to those who are proposing the removal of the effective lower bound, Cœuré asks: “why not instead focus on raising the natural real rate? Why not introduce structural reforms that will raise investment demand? This would be unambiguously positive for employment and productivity growth and. could have positive effects even over a relatively short time horizon.”Benoît Cœuré gave the speech on Monday, 18 May, at the conference “Removing the zero lower bound on interest rates”, organised by Imperial College Business School, Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis, CEPR and the Swiss National Bank"

The amended tax proposal cleared its first hurdle in parliament four weeks ago, with the backing of the leftist ruling coalition and several regional parties. The Bank of Spain recently estimated that the government will raise a combined €5 billion (US$5.2 billion) by 2024 from its proposed taxes on Spanish banks and large energy companies, which central bank Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said was less than the figure of €7 billion euros initially anticipated by the ruling coalition. In a speech posted by the central bank on its website, De Cos forecast that “the temporary levies on certain credit institutions and energy companies could together raise around €2.5 billion in 2023 and 2024.” In its initial plan set out in July, Spain’s government was planning to raise €3 billion from banks and €4 billion from large energy companies by 2024. Previous to yesterday’s final approval both tax proposals were amended and cleared last month in the lower house of Spain’s legislature during the first reading after some parties in northern regions approved an exemption of large energy firms’ domestic regulated activities and foreign operations. The new estimates by the central bank contrast with the government’s updated tax collection forecasts. Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero said last month that the government would collect only €400 million less than expected from the revised windfall tax proposal on energy companies. The banking tax was also amended to impose levies on the local units of foreign lenders after the European Central Bank (ECB) warned that the proposal could distort market competition. Spain faces challenging times in 2023 with sluggish economic growth and job creation, high but slowing inflation (6.8% year-on-year in November), sharply higher electricity bills due to the global energy crunch and water shortages in some areas due to drought. The economy grew by around 4.6% in 2022, but the figure masks a declining trend, due to falling consumption, shortages of raw materials, tighter financial conditions, the consequent rising financial burden on companies and households, and the inflation impact. Quarter-on-quarter growth dropped from 1.5% in Q2 to only 0.2% in Q3 and a possible slight contraction in Q4"

Seeking greater flexibility in the event FX volatility exceeds expectations, over 2,200 CFOs and treasurers directly interviewed as part of East & Partners long running Business FX United States programme revealed a step change in hedging intentions. A sequence of shocks to the global economy stemming from geopolitical tensions, ongoing Covid-19 pandemic impacts, lingering supply chain disruptions and recession fears has led to significant exchange rate adjustments according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Most notable is a strengthening of the US dollar as the US Federal Reserve (Fed) raises its target rate “faster and higher” than at any other time in recent history is reflected in cross-country disparities in “shock exposure” as central banks globally struggle to curtail rampant inflation. With US inflation recently hitting a 40-year high, the Fed has increased the effective federal funds rate by more than two percentage points in only six months, forcing US corporates to reassess their FX risk management strategy. East’s report notes that the Fed initially planned to increase its target rate to 4.40% by the end of 2022 yet raised interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) this month to range between 4.25% and 4.50%, well above the Fed’s long-term target of 2%. Evolving FX hedging behaviour is also reflected in heightened switching intentions with customer churn accelerating to record highs. US importers and exporters have never been more likely to shop around for both spot FX and risk products execution, driven by both pricing and service incentives in addition to innovative new digital tools and platform features. Citi, Bank of America and HSBC compete closely for forward FX relationship share leadership as each bank recorded exceptionally strong year-on-year growth rates.

A group of 130 former workers at VK Garment Factory in Mae Sot, who produced garments for the company’s ‘Florence & Fred’ label, have claimed that they were trapped in “effective forced labour, working 99-hour weeks for illegally low pay in appalling conditions”, among other allegations. The workers made jeans, denim jackets and other F&F clothes for adults and children for the Thai branch of Tesco’s business between 2017 and 2020. Tesco said the garments were sold only on the Thai market, although according to the newspaper it has seen images of labels written in English on clothes understood to be made there. Tesco was not involved in the day-to-day running of the factory beyond setting and checking standards and placing orders. However, workers in its supply chain are seeking to hold the company to account for allegedly failing to protect them. The lawsuit claims that although Tesco and UK multinational Intertek carried out audits and did not identify any unlawful activities, they should have been aware that the area is known for exploitation of workers. A spokeswoman from Tesco, told The Guardian: “Protecting the rights of everyone working in our supply chain is absolutely essential to how we do business. In order to uphold our stringent human rights standards, we have a robust auditing process in place across our supply chain and the communities where we operate. “Any risk of human rights abuses is completely unacceptable, but on the very rare occasions where they are identified, we take great care to ensure they are dealt with appropriately, and that workers have their human rights and freedoms respected. “The allegations highlighted are incredibly serious, and had we identified issues like this at the time they took place, we would have ended our relationship with this supplier immediately. “We understand the Thai labour court has awarded compensation to those involved, and we would continue to urge the supplier to reimburse employees for any wages they’re owed.” The report added that a claim has been issued in the high court and is expected to be served in the new year. Also facing legal action is Ek Chai, which was the Thai branch of Tesco’s business until it was sold to Charoen Pokphand Group in December 2020"

Speaking at this week’s Business Standard Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) Insight Summit, Das said: “Our view is that it should be prohibited because if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow, please mark my words the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies. “They have no underlying value. They have huge inherent risks for our macroeconomic and financial stability. I have yet to hear any credible argument about what public good or what public purpose it serves.” The term “private cryptocurrencies” is used to distinguish between a public cryptocurrency such as India’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, which are issued by private players, said insiders at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). “I think the term private cryptocurrency is a fashionable way of describing what is otherwise a 100% speculative activity and there is a talk that it should be regulated,” Das said. The RBI’s governor has previously stated that cryptocurrencies should be prohibited. His comments have particular weight currently as India is holding the presidency of the Group of 20 nations, giving it the power to set the agenda. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has identified the regulation of crypto assets as an international priority and will be a big topic of discussion during its G-20 presidency. “Countries have been taking different views,” added Das. “I don't think we need to say anything more about our stand after the developments over the last one year including the latest episode around FTX.” The governor’s comments also come at a time when the RBI is trying to create awareness around its CBDC, the e-rupee or digital rupee, and faces questions on whether CBDCs are in competition with private cryptocurrencies. “It's not a question of fear of missing out or of offering competition to a private cryptocurrency. I think that is how the world is going to evolve,” said Das when asked whether India’s CBDC was an “optic to fight crypto.” He added: “You will see in days to come more and more central banks will embrace digital currencies and India has been in the forefront of the digital revolution in the current century.”"

Testing would be conducted under a special legal regime currently under development. The monetary authority’s First Deputy Chairman, Olga Skorobogatova, announced earlier this week that the CBR aims to trial international trade settlements with cryptocurrencies. “We are now planning, within the framework of the experimental legal regime that we are preparing, to try the use of cryptocurrency for international settlements, that is, for foreign economic activity,” she said, quoted by the Tass news agency. Speaking at the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, Skorobogatova stated that the pilot project would be carried out with interested companies but did not specifically name any of the likely participants. Government institutions in Moscow have been working to expand the regulatory framework for digital financial assets to cover decentralised cryptocurrencies. The CBR. previously a strong opponent to their legalisation in Russia, has significantly softened its stance since the West imposed sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine, that have limited the country’s access to global finances and markets. In September, Deputy Minister of Finance Alexey Moiseev admitted that his department and the monetary policy regulator have agreed that, in current conditions, it would be impossible for Russia to do without cross-border settlements in cryptocurrency. However, the CBR is maintaining its position against allowing the free circulation of digital currencies like bitcoin under Russian jurisdiction, including domestic crypto payments. It recently backed legislation designed to regulate mining, provided the minted crypto is exchanged abroad or exclusively under special legal regimes inside Russia. The central bank will reportedly begin testing a digital rouble around April 2023. The exchange of the digital rouble for foreign currencies and the opening of digital wallets to non-residents is expected to follow in 2024"

The website has responded with an online article, Managing Your China Manufacturing and Supply Chains During Covid Outbreaks, ahead of a peak in new cases predicted over the winter months. “Businesses should, to the best of their ability, prepare for the impending disruption and formulate risk mitigation plans for at least the period until mid-2023,” the site recommends. “To help with this, we provide practical advice on dealing with disruptions in manufacturing and supply chains and highlight the positive impact that the lifting of COVID restrictions may have on businesses in China.” Since early 2020 the pandemic has impacted every aspect of the supply chain, from the procurement of raw materials to the end consumer. It has exposed vulnerabilities and resiliency gaps for many organisations while challenging the commercial, operational, financial, and organisational resilience of businesses worldwide, notes China Briefing. But a 10-measure notice issued by the National Health Commission on 7 December effectively removed requirements such as mandatory centralized quarantine, compulsory testing, and sweeping lockdowns. “While this sudden pivot in its COVID-19 approach has been welcomed by many businesses, the switch to living with COVID comes with its own risks and difficulties, such as a sudden spike in the number of cases,” the guide adds. “As such challenges may continue to hamper the recovery of manufacturing and supply chains, it is essential for businesses to find practical solutions. How can firms attempt to strengthen their supply chains going ahead as COVID-19 continues to impact global supply chains? In this article, we explore some of the disruptions to China’s manufacturing and supply chains and discuss key strategies for companies to become more resilient in the face of these sudden changes.”"

Earlier this week the IMF’s executive board approved a 46-month loan for Egypt, totalling more than US$3.1 billion. The fund will immediately disburse almost US$347 million. As part of the loan conditions, Egypt has committed to “a permanent shift to a flexible exchange rate regime to increase resilience against external shocks and to rebuild external buffers”. Egypt announced it would float the pound (E£) at the end of October. The country has faced high inflation, while the Egyptian pound has steadily lost value against other currencies, particularly the US dollar, leading many Egyptians to hoard gold and raising its price in the local market. A recent report by CNN commented that the Arab world’s most populous country “has dug itself a massive hole of debt”. Two devaluations of the currency this year were accompanied by sharp interest rate hikes and analysts expect a further hike to be announced later today"

Two years ago, the bank wired the entire balance of a US $900 million loan rather than just the interest and then failed to recover the majority of it when investors claimed Revlon was in default and should have repay them regardless. According to court document, this could stymie the company's restructuring plans. The issue is that it is unclear who, if anyone, has the right to repay the remaining $500 million in loan principal, which is embroiled in a legal battle over the accidental transfer. Citigroup said it assumed rights as a creditor to the troubled company after losing the first round of the battle with lenders who kept the erroneous payment last year. However, Revlon has hinted in regulatory filings last month and bankruptcy court filings this week that Citigroup's claim to the funds is not certain, opening the possibility of yet another confounding debt dispute. According to Eric Talley, a Columbia University law professor who has studied the Citi-Revlon debacle, Revlon would prefer that this debt be completely erased from its books and transfer responsibility to Citibank. Additionally, Talley states that although the so-called subrogation rights Citigroup asserts it has over the principal of the $500 million loan are a common idea in insurance law, they have not been extensively tested in the financial realm. Despite the scant precedent that currently exists, which certainly favours Citigroup, Revlon's poor financial situation surely makes even a remote possibility of wiping out the debt worth considering, he added. Revlon stated that it ""reserves all rights and defences with respect to any claim Citibank may assert against"" the business if Citigroup finally fails in its attempt to recover the funds. If Citigroup's claim is successfully contested, over 15% of Revlon's $3.4 billion in debt might be instantly written off, easing the company's road out of bankruptcy. According to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Phil Brendel, the odds are against Revlon and may run the risk of severing the company's relationship with Citigroup"

This investment will reportedly leverage another $25 million in senior debt to invest $50 million in CBEA's near-term pipeline of solar-powered mini-grids. According to reports, CBEA plans to invest a total of $150 million over the next two years to provide sustainable electricity to a million people in Africa. The mini-grids reportedly use solar and batteries to deliver grid-quality power to homes and businesses on a continuous basis. Individual local residential and small business subscribers will be able to access renewable electricity for the first time. Reports indicate that these solar-powered mini-grids will aid in bringing clean electricity to rural African areas that currently lack access to electricity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that the solar mini-grid sector will require $187 billion to achieve universal energy access by 2030. According to CBEA, project finance is critical to unlocking the long-term, infrastructure-type capital required by the mini-grid sector. CBEA launched its blended project finance structure in 2019 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, Ceniarth, the DOEN Foundation, the Shell Foundation and UK Aid. The IEA states that more than 600 million Africans lack access to electricity. This slows economic growth, productive investment, job creation and poverty alleviation. The report states that CBEA's blended finance approach establishes a new model for funding rural electrification in Africa, bringing renewable energy to one million people once the target $150 million is fully deployed. Amy Brusiloff, Community Development Executive for Environmental, Social and Governance, Bank of America, also stated that “this innovative blended finance structure by CrossBoundary Energy Access aggregates renewable energy mini-grid projects to achieve scale and reduce risk, which more readily enables large institutions to invest.”"

Digital transactions continue to increase across multiple platforms, with the total value expected to reach US $5,317 million by later 2022. By enabling real-time digital access across payment gateways and smart devices, cashless service delivery levels are being transformed, according to reports. In line with the regulator's efforts to drive digital transactions, Visa's new service reportedly enables card-to-card transactions with speed, security and convenience for the user. Consumers can use Visa Direct to make payments directly to another Visa card using card credentials via the P2P facility. Avanthi Colombage, Country Manager for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Visa, commented that this enables them to manage digital money transfers between two parties in real time. It is also said to improve mobility and access to cashless payments across multiple segments. Additionally, this Visa Direct solution could enable and improve bank-to-bank transfers, credit card bill payments, use of digital wallets, transfers on social media and bulk fund disbursements in the near future, transforming the payment landscape in Sri Lanka. Reports indicated that while Sri Lankan banks can now provide the service to their customers through bank apps, internet banking, ATMs or branch counters, fintechs can also provide the service to a diverse range of consumers through fintech apps. With the continued growth in digital transactions, Visa expects P2P transactions to exponentially grow transfers between individuals due to the inherent ease of transferring funds in real-time from one Visa credential to another.

It plans to use the new $4M in funds to expand its capabilities in conversational AI and other digital offerings and grow its team to meet market demand in the UK and European markets. Webio's technology has enabled UK and European companies to communicate with customers in a conversational manner throughout the credit and collections process. Customers can reportedly use Conversational AI and automation to ask questions, change payment dates, or create a new repayment schedule that is tailored to their specific needs, resulting in better adherence to repayments. Webio's ability to “move the needle” in predicting conversation outcomes by analysing what is said and how it is said has been called a significant achievement. A critical capability in this market is identifying characteristics such as a person's potential vulnerability first and accurately, and then guiding customer conversations through a range of best next steps. Money-related conversations are challenging and difficult for both the customer and the agents who are tasked with having these conversations. Cormac O'Neill, Co-Founder and CEO, Webio, commented that “going digital allows businesses to create a whole new set of digital experiences that help customers feel more confident in having those difficult conversations, ultimately preventing them from falling into unnecessary and significant financial difficulty.” Furthermore, O’Neill added that they are growing at a rate of more than 100% year-on-year and hope to double their staff in the next six months with this investment, as well as seeking additional capital to enter new markets. Credit and collections functions have historically received little technological attention, but digital transformation is now a requirement. The number of financial services organizations implementing conversational AI and digital assistants has more than doubled over the pandemic, and Webio's privacy-first custom assistant model is gaining traction in the collection's world. Between the current economic environment’s impact on individuals and the dramatic rise of BNPL and other alternative payments, all businesses will face increased late payments, bad debt, and cash flow pressure, reports state. Companies are realizing that they need a strategy for serving these customers with care and empathy, and many are hopeful that conversational AI options such as Webio can help"

The bank said that the five-year bond provides exposure to three-month USD Libor with a floor, payable quarterly. The proceeds will fund green projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, water quality and conservation, and green buildings as defined in Citi’s green bond framework.

“This issuance is the next step in our commitment to supporting sustainable finance and growing investor appetite in the green bond market,” said Bhaavit Agrawal, global head of rates structured notes at Citi. “The bond is a floored floating rate note and is structured to combine the benefits of a tailored approach towards risk-return with sustainability criteria.”
Citi was a co-founder of the International Capital Market Association’s (ICMA) green bond principles (GBP) in 2014 and has since had a key role in the development of the market. In January, the group announced its inaugural green bond issues as a €1 billion three-year fixed rate offering

Fitch Ratings has made further large cuts to global GDP forecasts in its latest Global Economic Outlook (GEO) in response to coronavirus-related lockdown extensions and incoming data flows.
“World GDP is now expected to fall by 3.9% in 2020, a recession of unprecedented depth in the post-war period,” said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. “This is twice as large as the decline anticipated in our early April GEO update and would be twice as severe as the 2009 recession.”
The decline in GDP equates to a US$2.8 trillion fall in global income levels relative to 2019 and a loss of US$4.5 trillion relative to Fitch’s pre-virus expectations of 2020 global GDP. Fitch expects eurozone GDP to decline by 7%, US GDP by 5.6%, and UK GDP by 6.3% in 2020.
The biggest downward revisions are in the eurozone, where the measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus have already taken a very heavy toll on activity in Q1 2020. Italy’s 2020 GDP forecast has been cut to -8% following official indications that GDP already fell 5% in Q1 2020 and after a recent extension of the lockdown there. Official estimates also point to France and Spain experiencing near 5% declines in GDP in the quarter, with the Spanish outlook hit particularly hard by the collapse in tourism. Even allowing for a slightly less negative outlook for Germany - where the headroom for policy easing is greater and the benefits of a recovery in China will be felt more directly - eurozone GDP is expected to shrink by 7% this year.
No country or region has been spared from the devastating economic impact of the global pandemic. Fitch says it now anticipates that GDP in both the US and the UK - where lockdowns started a little later than in the eurozone - will decline by more than 10% (not annualised) in Q2 2020, compared to forecasts of around 7% in its early April update. This will result in annual GDP declines of around 6%, despite aggressive macro policy easing.
A notable feature of this update is sharp further downward revisions to GDP forecasts for emerging markets (EM)"

This will result in annual GDP declines of around 6%, despite aggressive macro policy easing.
A notable feature of this update is sharp further downward revisions to GDP forecasts for emerging markets (EM). Falling commodity prices, capital outflows and more-limited policy flexibility are exacerbating the impact of domestic virus-containment measures; Mexico, Brazil, Russia, South Africa and Turkey have all seen big GDP forecast adjustments. With China and India both now expected to see sub-1% growth, Fitch says it expects an outright contraction in EM GDP in 2020, a development unprecedented since at least the 1980s. The ratings agency expects supply responses and a relaxation of lockdowns to help oil prices to recover in the second half of the year from current lows, which are being  exacerbated by storage capacity issues in the US and elsewhere.
Several major economies recently have extended lockdown measures, and Fitch says it now needs to incorporate national lockdowns of around eight or nine weeks as a central case assumption for most major advanced economies. This contrasts to its previous assumption of around five weeks. An extra month of lockdown would, all else being equal, reduce the annual flow of income (GDP) by around 2 percentage points.
In addition, incoming data - including official ‘flash’ GDP estimates for Q1 2020, monthly activity indicators for March and weekly labour market data - point to a daily loss of activity through lockdown episodes of closer to 25% than the 20% assumed previously. This is consistent with the recently released outturn for growth in China when GDP declined by 10% quarter-on-quarter in Q1 2020, a period encompassing entry to and exit from a five-week lockdown.
“Macro policy responses have been unprecedented in scale and scope and will serve to cushion the near-term shock,” added Coulton. “But with job losses occurring on an extreme scale and intense pressures on small and medium-sized businesses, the path back to normality after the health crisis subsides is likely to be slow"

Our forecasts now show US and eurozone GDP remaining below pre-virus (Q4 2019) levels through the whole of 2021.
Over half of CFOs expect 30% revenue decline in 2020
Bearing in mind the scale of the downturn, it is understandable that corporates are bracing themselves for a major revenue hit this year. As such, a Gartner survey of 145 CFOs and senior finance leaders on 12 April 2020 has revealed 51% of respondents said they were preparing for a revenue contraction of up to 30% this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some 28% of respondents believe the impact to their organisation’s revenue could be even higher than 30%.
“Most CFOs have told us they are using the most severe downside scenarios to inform their decisions right now,” said Alexander Bant, practice vice president, research, for the Gartner Finance Practice. “This is leading CFOs to consider drastic cost management actions across April and May. When CFOs were asked how these downside scenarios are impacting their ability to fund long-term growth investments, 70% of CFOs said they are now showing caution in this area.” 
While 15% of CFOs were planning to completely suspend all or most long-term investments, half (50%) said they were suspending them on a selective basis. An additional 30% said they had no plans to suspend most investments, and the remaining 5% said they are already replacing previous long-term investments with new investments.
“We know from studying companies that were successful during prior business cycle turns, that investing in growth bets ahead of curve is vital to come out on top,” said Bant. “Right now, we see CFOs clamping down on funding for these growth bets. The companies that emerge as leaders in their industry will quickly pivot and replace previous long-term growth investments with new ones. Currently though, only 5% of companies appear to be making these changes.”
For CFOs to guide the business through rethinking these investments, they need a solid theory of how their customer is changing"

The companies that emerge as leaders in their industry will quickly pivot and replace previous long-term growth investments with new ones. Currently though, only 5% of companies appear to be making these changes.”
For CFOs to guide the business through rethinking these investments, they need a solid theory of how their customer is changing. In normal conditions, the most effective CFOs spend between 5-10% of their time with customers. In crisis mode, Gartner recommends CFOs to spend more time on the front line listening to how their key customers are modeling out the recovery and what things will change.
CFOs also indicated in the poll that most expect little or no delay to closing their books at the end of Q1 2020. Just 3% expected a delay of more than three days, 65% expected no delay, and 28% expected a delay of three days or less.
“These results show that the finance function is generally coping well with remote working and is able to carry out a lot of work as usual,” said Bant. “In fact, recent data from another Gartner poll showed CFOs warming to the idea of remote working as a cost management tactic.”"

Founded in 2018, Crowdz received backing from Oracle, BOLD Capital Partners and Barclays Bank to create InvoiceXchange, a global platform that enables SMEs to get paid faster by submitting invoices for bank or investor financing, without the need to file paperwork.
Built on the Ethereum blockchain, InvoiceXchange addresses challenges like KYC, AML title ownership to maintain a fully-transparent, single source of truth to pre-vetted funders, while enabling SMEs to receive dozens of offers for financing, improving SME cashflow by unlocking capital otherwise tied up in invoices.
“SMEs are the backbone of our economy, and our goal is to accelerate SME profitability by enabling access to real-time working capital, so more business can flourish,” commented Payson E. Johnston, CEO and co-founder at Crowdz.

7807,3374,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/four-trends-shaping-ma-in-2018,Four trends shaping M&A in 2018,2018-01-08,,"The mergers and acquisitions (M&A) outlook for 2018 is robust according to a statement from EY, pointing to significant growth opportunity for global corporates in the year ahead. The consultancy firm says there is a heightened appetite for M&A deals in the next 12 months and digital transformation is one of the main drivers behind this, as innovative start-ups and tech businesses are targeted by global corporates. Last year, deal values fell by 7 per cent but the number of deals was up 6 per cent and EY thinks this trend – with fewer 'mega deals' – could continue in 2018, due to increasing regulatory scrutiny of big mergers.
However, US tax reform could lead to more big deals in the near term, says EY's Steve Krouskos: “US tax reform could trigger some near-term large deals, but the biggest M&A story of 2018 will be the continuing era of portfolio transformation. Companies will continue to reshape themselves and acquire technology and digital assets that will help define their future. Tech-smart deals will help companies future-proof their operations and address continuously changing business models.”
Some of the trends EY expects to see in M&A during 2018 include:
Private equity at 10-year high
M&A driven by private equity (PE) reached a 10-year high in 2017 and further activity can be expected in 2018, as PE buyers join forces with companies on bigger deals. Krouskos says: “We have become accustomed to PE and corporates competing for the same assets. The emerging trend of collaboration on M&A should result in more deal activity overall as these new kinds of alliances come to the deal table.”
Cross-border expansion
There will be an acceleration of cross-border dealmaking in 2018, with companies in Europe and beyond looking for M&A targets outside their own national borders. More activity is expected from Chinese corporates looking to invest outside China. Krouskos says: “Globally integrated business models and supply chains that stretch across many borders are a fact of life. There is no way or reason to unravel that and dealmaking in 2018 will continue to reflect the interconnected business world, despite any protectionist sentiment.”
Regulatory and geopolitical risks
Regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical uncertainty are two of the top risks to business M&A, according to corporate executives"

There is no way or reason to unravel that and dealmaking in 2018 will continue to reflect the interconnected business world, despite any protectionist sentiment.”
Regulatory and geopolitical risks
Regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical uncertainty are two of the top risks to business M&A, according to corporate executives. Krouskos says: “Companies are proactively finding solutions to regulatory challenges to help ensure deals are done. They know that standing still from an M&A perspective is no longer an option.”
Inclusive growth
Executives in the Global Capital Confidence Barometer (October 2017) noted their need to justify and communicate the need for M&A deals to a variety of stakeholders, including shareholders, regulators, employees and local communities. As such, M&A deals need to be about bringing value above and beyond the bottom line. Krouskos says: “The ‘purpose’ of a deal now needs to speak beyond typical synergies and cost savings to address the concept of inclusive growth. Articulating this narrative in a compelling way to ensure all stakeholders are onside will become increasingly key to unlocking future M&A opportunities.”"

This year it comprised a virtual three-day meeting that had attracted more than 2,000 delegates online by its first day. Anticipating a gradual return to normality over the coming months and the resumption of traditional meetings, Vienna was confirmed as the venue for EBAday 2022 next May.

The morning discussion featured Sara Castelhano, EMEA Head of Payments Product & Solutions for J P Morgan and Deutsche Bank’s Head of Corporate & Payment Solutions, Cash Management, Christof Hofmann. Moderator Marc Niederkorn, a partner of McKinsey & Co described global payments as representing a US$2 trillion opportunity and a “remarkably resilient industry” that continued to thrive despite the pandemic and contributed a growing share of banking revenue. However, these revenues were under increasing pressure as the costs of tech investment and increasing regulation continued to rise and the incumbent financial services providers faced competition from three other contenders, FinTech, BigTech and Merchants/other players in the move towards a world where making payments will increasingly be an invisible process. An audience poll that posed the question “What are the most important dimensions (of payments) that need attention?” drew the following response: Payments infrastructure and technology: 32.5% Payments economics (sources of revenue/cost): 12.3% Product innovations (real-time, cross-border etc): 37.7% Competitors (in particular bigtechs, fintechs): 8.8% Changes of paradigm (digital currency, stablecoins, CBDCs): 8.8% In a second poll, which posited the statement “Payments is a core part of my institution’s ambition and future strategy”, 79.7% indicated they totally agreed and 17.6% “somewhat” agreed, leaving only 2.7% dissenting. Hofmann said that the payments industry was already in the middle of a revolution that many banks struggled to keep up with due to legacy infrastructure. For them, future proofing depended on the ability to be innovative. Castelhano agreed, observing that innovation started with the end-to-end user experience, which the industry has made unnecessarily complex in the past. “Innovation should be driven by the customer and not the regulator,” suggested Niederkorn. Change and innovation were words that also regularly featured in the session “Correspondent banking – a business in transformation”"

The session was moderated by Veerle Damen, Head of Network Management, Propositions and Customer Journeys, NatWest. As Sposito commented, despite geopolitical tensions in recent years the global economy “is here to stay” and will continue to grow as client demand for cross-border payments grows with it. As the correspondent banking network enables payments to be made around the world within seconds, those in the industry needed to keep working hard and to continue innovating. However, to do so requires a level playing field and regulators were currently treating banks very differently from non-banks; in particular placing them under intense scrutiny regarding their anti- money laundering (AML) policies"

Panellist Christian Hausherr, Product Manager Trade Finance/Supply Chain Finance at Deutsche Bank noted that there was an ongoing move to open account or supply chain finance. It was driven by the ‘pull’ factor of companies wanting to maximise their working capital as well as the ‘push’ factor of technology being adopted that makes supply chain finance possible. For him, SCF only works when based on mutual trust between the parties involved, which allows trading to be on an open account basis. Michael Glaros, Principal Program Manager, Microsoft said that as physical supply chains and financial flows steadily converse, cloud computing technology was being adopted to reduce integration friction. The risk was expanding as connectivity and networking increases, providing more opportunities for the “bad guys” to intercept. Digital adoption is now reaching smaller companies as they move away from paper-based processes and innovations such as ISO 20022 are introduced, added José Vicente, Deputy Manager of Millennium bcp. Open account is nothing new, but as the world becomes more real time and data-oriented the improved processes developed around cash management are being applied to the global environment, noted Peter Hazou, Director of Business Development, Microsoft. “Up until 2008 everything appeared to be steadily moving towards open account, but the financial crisis breathed new life into trade finance, which has always been able to attract innovators,” he added. “Open account is alluring, but at the same time it involves a lot of elements that create risk.” Asked how prevalent open account is, Hausherr responded that it depends on which region and the size of the client. “Most of the world’s 500 biggest companies use SCF, although it’s less prevalent among smaller companies,” he reported. “The majority of big buyers have a payables finance programme in place; however classic factoring still plays an important role in Europe. SMEs that currently use classic factoring may in future move over to reverse factoring, as it has a number of attractive features”"

The discussion also touched on ISO 20022’s introduction and its expected impact “From a payments perspective it will help the banks to provide better services,” said Vicente. “It’s a great opportunity to bring in all of the sectors of the bank; as digitalisation won’t solve everything so we need to involve everyone. Banks are trying to develop their end-to-end capabilities using the new data and digital IDs is something that companies will soon have.”"

The European Central Bank has indicated that a digital euro is in development, Facebook plans to launch its Diem currency soon and El Salvador recently confirmed bitcoin as a legal currency.1 Sweden and Bermuda are moving ahead with digital versions of their currency and JP Morgan has created the JPM coin for payments. These developments were addressed by Robert Bosch, Partner of Bearing Point, who moderated a discussion about central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) on Day Three. An audience poll on ‘Do we need CBDCs?’ showed nearly half were in favour, but nearly one in three opposed: Yes: 47% No: 31.5% Perhaps: 22.5% “Crypto is digital, widely accessible and token based, whereas a CBDC is peer-to-peer and issued by a central authority”Marion Laboure, Macro Strategist, Deutsche Bank Session panellist Marion Laboure, Macro Strategist for Deutsche Bank and Lecturer in Economic and Finance at the Economics Faculty of Harvard University commented that the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) defines four basic dimensions for money: who is the issuer?; how accessible is it?; is the support physical or only digital?; and is the transmission peer-to-peer or through an intermediary? Crypto is digital, widely accessible and token based, whereas a CBDC is peer-to-peer and issued by a central authority. For Dirk Schrade, Deputy Head of Department Payments and Settlement Systems at Deutsche Bundesbank, the potential development of the CBDC rests on whether it can become widely used in response to continuing digital innovation and a general decline in the use of cash. “Public trust in the monetary system could be improved by providing a public form of digital money that could act as cash in making peer-to-peer transactions possible,” he said. “You can’t very comfortably use cash in an e-commerce environment, so there will be certain benefits and virtues with a CBDC that make it different from cash.” There is also the question of whether CBDCs can help to promote an open and innovative ecosystem and improve financial stability. Sophia Bantanidis, Head of Regulatory Strategy and Policy TTS Innovation, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi suggested that they could potentially make things easier; for example, digital traceability could help reduce opportunities for tax evasion"

Sophia Bantanidis, Head of Regulatory Strategy and Policy TTS Innovation, Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi suggested that they could potentially make things easier; for example, digital traceability could help reduce opportunities for tax evasion. But there are other potential scenarios in which CBDCs might actually work against stability. “Crypto works best as a public-private partnership,” she suggested. “So CBDCs should build on existing foundations – a ‘Goldilocks’ scenario in which it is neither too big or too small is ideal. Too big and there is the risk of the private sector being driven out.” Asked which countries have made most progress on CBDC development, Jack Fletcher, Government Relations Manager, Digital Currencies at R3 commented that the question implied a prize for whoever is first, although there might be an advantage in being, say, the fourth or fifth in order to learn from the mistakes of whoever is first. “In APAC, the Bank for International Settlements is co-ordinating work and the Monetary Authority of Singapore has also been at the forefront. The European Central Bank talks of a five- year timeframe for the introduction of the digital euro,” he said. “A multi-tiered system using a central infrastructure looks to be the best arrangement. But we’re all moving at different speeds and a four to five year timeline appears to be commonplace in the US and Europe.”"

She opened with a reminder of the challenges inherent in innovation, citing Thomas Edison’s quote, “I’ve only found 10,000 ways that don’t work. I haven’t failed,” as an important perspective for the innovation process, which rarely yields perfect solutions on the first attempt. The struggle for global payments innovation is one such challenge. While the demand is there in force, it is often trumped by the practicalities of local idiosyncrasies in the banking or payments environment. For example, Sweden’s mobile payments app, Swish, works wonderfully in the Nordic cooperative banking environment, but the same approach wouldn’t translate to the US, which has thousands of banks and competition at the payment level itself. India has become a gold standard of innovation and the cashless society, but the regulatory involvement that made those innovations thrive would be impossible in, say, Germany, which remains very cash-focused, even in a post-pandemic environment. An audience poll (below) found that peer-to-peer (P2P) is still regarded as the most innovative market segment, but since a similar poll was conducted five years ago business-to-consumer (B2C) has narrowed the gap significantly. Citing the example of Spain’s Bizum, Deutsche Bank’s Head of Global Payments, Corporate Cash Management Christian Schäfer explained that the market has various great P2P solutions that subsequently move into the field of B2C. The discussion also touched on the impact of customer-led innovation and panellists agreed that regulation had also contributed to it in recent years. An audience question suggested that ISO 20022 was an opportunity to leverage data and transform the industry, but had yet to deliver on this promise. Jon Levine, Co-Head of Institutional Banking at Banking Circle noted that some in the industry questioned whether ISO 20022 simply reorganises the same old data. Although he didn’t agree, would he go so far as to call ISO 20022 a panacea? “Definitely not. It is a step in the right direction though,” he opined. “Remediation work is ongoing because the standard isn’t being met yet. There will have to be further improvements over time, but it will create loads more data eventually"

For this to happen, there needs to be progress on an institutional level about the transparency and availability of data and there needs to be standardisation. “The tipping point, the enabler on top of these two factors, is business models. There needs to be a frame and a scheme within which the exchange of data is governed and focused – and which comes with remuneration for those holding the data on behalf of others and those designing business models on top of that. We found that no one institution can manage that – it really requires extrapolation into a four-corner model.” For this purpose, the EPRB invited the EPC to become the scheme owner, which “will bring the next level of baseline to enable business models and innovation around data.”"

Asked to pick the main challenges over the months ahead, an audience poll selected the following: Overall readiness (54.4%) Differences in migration strategy and timelines between MIs (28.1%) Benefits of ISO 20022 are not fully understood (17.5%) The session, moderated by Tanja Haase, Customer Engagement Lead – Transaction Management at SWIFT, asked panellists their view on the current state of ISO 20022 readiness. Daniele Pasqualini, Head of GTR RFP and Onboarding at Intesa Sanpaolo suggested that the large banks are probably well prepared but smaller banks might lack the budget or resources needed to meet the November 2022 deadline. “We need to have these banks connected as well”, she added. For Volker Heinze, Head of Business Development at UniFits, ISO 20022 is “the new sheriff in town” and means the same level playing field for all. “Based on this, I see interoperability, and the richer data is an enabler for innovation in payments. And instant payments, request to pay, and the European payment initiative is part of this. In the past month, I’ve received many invitations to hackathons around ISO 20022, so this topic is interesting for fintechs as well.” Will the benefits of ISO 20022 more than outweigh the significant investment required? Right now, it’s difficult to assess said Neil Brady, Head of Transaction and Surveillance Operations, Deutsche Bank. “We have to take a more medium to longer term view,” he suggested. “When we look at what is going to happen, and compare it to other industries such as telecommunications and the technology industry, which have common practices in place, you can clearly see the benefits of that as well from economic globalisation perspective. I see no reason why we can't reach those same benefits within the banking and payments environment over the coming years. “And it's not just about the benefits to the banks, but also about the benefit to our clients and the end consumers. That’s something we mustn't forget. At the end of the day, there will be some bumps in the road over the next few years"

Huggins writes: “The danger from weak links in the supply chain takes two forms: suppliers can be disrupted as a result of cyber attack, with a knock-on effect on the bank or financial institution, or they can be a vector in a direct attack.” Some of the questions corporates need to be asking themselves include: Do you place high levels of trust in the staff or IT of any particular participants? Do your suppliers’ risk governance processes provide similar levels of assurance as your own? Have you built trust relationships with key suppliers? Do you use regular forums and communications in a manner similar to your customer relationship management? Have you considered combining capability sharing with a cyber-insurance policy you purchase on behalf of the supply chain, to provide an incentive for suppliers to take advantage of the offer?The full list of 20 questions is given in this article"
7821,3377,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/10-trends-that-will-drive-the-future-of-payments,10 trends that will drive the future of payments,2018-01-15,,"These 10 trends are based on Accenture’s 2017 North America Consumer Payments Pulse Survey of 1,500 consumers in the United States and Canada.
1. Today's teens will change payments
Generation Z – current teenagers born in the 21st century – are the digital natives that expect immediate and personalised online and mobile experiences, shaping how they will use payments in future – and by 2020 they will make up 40 per cent of all US consumers. They are more likely than older generations to want to make instant person-to-person payments and a third of Gen Z consumers want to share their payments on social media, compared to only three per cent of Baby Boomers.
2. Customer experience is the new gold
Customer experience is becoming the prime competitive differentiator – just as Open Banking regulation (PSD2 in the EU) means that traditional banks are losing their exclusive relationships with their customers. The Accenture survey suggests that more than half of younger people – those under 35 – would be willing to share online bank account credentials with third parties.
3. Mobile gathers pace
The survey found that 23 per cent of consumers would give up their mobile banking app for a digital wallet with all their payments information in one place. And 64 per cent of consumers plan to use a mobile wallet in 2020, up from 46 per cent today.
4. Consumers want rewards
Almost half – 48 per cent – of consumers would switch their primary rewards card to get more value for their purchases, and 42 per cent would switch for a large up-front, sign-up bonus. Rewards are a strong motivation for consumers but the market is changing, with rewards likely to become more personalised and experience/lifestyle-based in future.
5. Bank collaboration gets bigger
Collaboration between banks – what Accenture calls the 'network effect' – is leading to multibank projects for innovative payment solutions, such as Zelle in the US, an API-enabled network of more than 30 partners, enabling real-time payments across thousands of banks and millions of consumers. Accenture's report says that “collaboration is bigger and bolder than ever before”.
6. Fintechs and bank fusion
Collaboration will make the payments fintech landscape unrecognisable in a decade"

6. Fintechs and bank fusion
Collaboration will make the payments fintech landscape unrecognisable in a decade. While traditional banks have infrastructure, industry knowledge, brand reputation and huge customer bases, fintech companies contribute expertise in disruptive technologies and the ability to innovate flexibly.
7. All in the code
Accenture explains: ""Accounts are identified by a string of numbers. But with EMV, every credit card account becomes software code. Code that runs securely and can produce a different number every time. Combine this with advancing digital payments technologies, and the potential is mind boggling. Over the next few decades, this change will disrupt nearly every aspect of payments.”
8. Everyone can accept payments
The Eureka moment for solving the problem of individuals accepting card payments came in 1999 when Paypal found a way to enable individuals in effect to become a POS – a practice that is prevalent now, with applications such as PayPal, Venmo, Stripe and Square. This trend is set to continue, as more people will be able to accept card payments on their mobile devices.
9. Criminal innovation
Accenture's report states: “Criminals are making it their full-time job to out-innovate the payments industry.” It also writes that the credit card industry can expect to see $31.3 billion of losses in global card fraud in 2018 – an 18 per cent increase since 2013.
10. Time for infrastructure change
Traditional payment systems that settle transactions over several days are no longer fit for purpose in tomorrow's world of real-time, immediate payments. Calling today's technology 'monolithic', Accenture's report says: “Ripping and replacing will give payments companies newfound technical flexibility.”
Accenture's infographic, below, summarises the 10 consumer payment trends:"

True offshore international RMB payments are transactions taking place between RMB centres (e.g. Singapore, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, etc.) without involving China and Hong Kong.
Based on the RMB Tracker, clearing centres such as Singapore, United Kingdom and the newly appointed German centre are driving true offshore use of the RMB. Other countries, such as Belgium that are not normally part of the RMB top ten, are also fuelling this offshore trend. Belgium currently sits fourth for true offshore RMB international payments. Over the last nine months, SWIFT has noted a significant increase in all RMB offshore centres with Singapore holding its leading position at +574% growth, followed by Luxembourg (+517%) and the United Kingdom (+236%).

""Payments, FX and trade finance are the markers to watch for growth in RMB internationalisation,"" says Alex Medana, Director, Securities Markets, Asia Pacific, SWIFT. ""The RMB is primarily used as a trade settlement currency, but it is worth noting that the RMB is steadily making progress as an investment currency.  In the first nine months of 2014, 28% of securities settlement confirmations in RMB were done outside China and Hong Kong, compared to 16% during the same period two years ago.""
Use of RMB expands in many different ways
New examples of the use of RMB are announced at least weekly:

WPG Holdings, a Taiwan-headquartered electronics distributor, has partnered up with Standard Chartered to sweep renminbi through the Shanghai FTZ
Powerlong uses RMB bond to pay off debts
according to research firm Aite, “The use of the renminbi in trade finance will increase significantly over the next three to five years.

No wonder The Banker magazine described the RMB progress as the “The unstoppable march of the renminbi.”
Global RMB ranking
Unsurprisingly, the RMB strengthened its position as the seventh-ranked global payments currency and accounted for 1.72% of global payments, an all-time record share. In September 2014, the value of RMB global payments increased by 13.2%, well above the average 8.1% growth for all currencies.
Long term future for RMB
Bankers are starting to wonder how far the RMB could develop. “The US dollar has long occupied pole position in the international currency system, but could China’s renminbi grow to challenge the established hierarchy??” mused Kok-Keong Tay, Head of GTB Asia at UniCredit. Although, Chinese regulation is still a limiting factor"

The data reviewed how long SMEs are waiting to be paid, how late these payments were and the impact. The key findings were

Late payments doubled from 12 days in 2018 to 23 days in 2019
39% of invoices were paid late in 2019, marginal improvement from 43% in 2018
Average of £34,286 owed in late invoices, businesses waiting on £34b in late payments 
Larger businesses take longer to settle bills than smaller counterparts
German debtors taking twice as long to pay invoices in 2019. While French, Italian and Spanish businesses improved on late payment to UK companies.

Typical UK business
The analysis suggests that businesses typically agree on 45-day payment terms from completion of work or delivery of goods. Despite this, almost two-fifths (39%) of invoices issued in 2019 (worth over £34b2) were paid late, an improvement in 2018 when 43% of invoices were paid late. However, the number of days an invoice was paid late in 2019 has doubled to 23 days from 12 days in 2018. Invoices paid late were typically larger in value (£34,286) than those paid on time (£24,624).
Other key insights were:

The number of invoices with long payments terms (anywhere between 60 and 120 days) being paid late almost doubled between 2013 and 2019. Rising from 13% being paid late in 2013 to 23% in 2019. 
Over the 6-year period, the analysis found that larger debtors insisted on longer payment terms (49 days) than smaller debtors (37 days). In addition, when invoices were paid late, these larger debtors also settled much later (94 days) compared to smaller debtors (42 days).

Bilal Mahmood, External Relations Director at MarketFinance, commented:


“It’s great to see that fewer invoices were paid late in 2019 but worryingly, those that were paid late took twice as long as in 2018, up from 12 days to 23 days. Late payment practices harm business cash flow, hampers investment and, in extreme cases, can risk business solvency"

Separate research we’ve conducted highlighted that 87% of businesses are prevented from taking on more orders because of the cashflow constraint owing to late payments. Overall it seems who you are doing business with and where they are based is important to know for a small business if they need to forecast cashflow”.



“Government measures such as the Prompt Payment Code and Duty To Report have helped create awareness but need more bite.  Until this happens, there are ways for SMEs to fight back against the negative impact of late payments, from having frank discussions with debtors that continuously fail to adhere to agreed payment terms, to imposing sanctions on those debtors, or seeking out invoice finance facilities to bridge the gap

This experiment examined whether distributed ledger technology (DLT) could improve the efficiency of cross-border wholesale payments and settlements involving multiple currencies. 
The technical research experiment built on previous phases of the NYIC’s Project Cedar research and the MAS’ Ubin+ initiative. It examined a cross-border multi-currency use case in which vehicle currencies are used as a bridge to exchange currency pairs that are not widely traded. 
Specifically, Cedar x Ubin+ explored the ability of DLT to establish connectivity across heterogeneous simulated currency ledgers, reduce settlement risk, and decrease settlement time. The experiment was conducted in a test environment, and the hypothetical payments were settled using simulated wholesale central bank digital currencies. 
“Cross-border payments are a major railway for facilitating the functioning of the global economy,” said Michelle Neal, Head of the Markets Group at the New York Fed. “Our research collaboration with the MAS reveals key opportunities for central bank innovation to play an important role in easing wholesale payment flows globally and improving settlement outcomes.
Addressing common pain points
The Cedar x Ubin+ experiment demonstrated that DLT could support cross-border multi-currency payments and settlement enhancements. The findings addressed three key pain points related to network interoperability and autonomy, settlement, and speed:

Interoperability and autonomy: The Cedar x Ubin + experiment interlinked the distinct central bank currency ledgers, providing flexibility in the design and operation of each ledger to the respective central bank. This enabled payments to be safely executed across multiple ledgers without the need for a central clearing authority or the establishment of a shared central network.
Atomic settlement: The simulated payments were settled atomically, meaning transactions were only settled if all legs in the cross-currency payment chains were executed successfully. This improved the certainty of settlement, addressing existing pain points such as counterparty risks.
Near real-time settlement: Each simulated payment scenario achieved an end-to-end settlement in under thirty seconds on average. This enabled participants to be notified of a payment’s success in seconds"

Near real-time settlement: Each simulated payment scenario achieved an end-to-end settlement in under thirty seconds on average. This enabled participants to be notified of a payment’s success in seconds.

The study revealed research areas for future experimentation and analysis, including the viability of the network solution to manage transaction volumes at scale, with potentially an increase in payments settled per second and the involvement of additional currencies supported by their corresponding central bank ledgers.
Project Cedar is a multi-phase technical research effort evaluating financial technology solutions' potential applications to improve cross-border wholesale payments' efficiency. Phase I of Project Cedar found that wholesale payments supported by DLT could improve the speed and safety of cross-border transactions. 
Project Cedar aims to contribute to a broad and transparent dialogue about innovation in the financial sector. The Cedar x Ubin+ report is not intended to advance any specific policy outcome, nor to signal that the Federal Reserve or the MAS will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness of issuing a CBDC or any other product or service, nor indicate how one would necessarily be designed. 
While DLT was explored as a potential solution in Cedar x Ubin+, alternative technical designs may also provide viable solutions. The Federal Reserve System has made no decisions as to optimal technical design. 
Ubin+ is MAS’ initiative focused on wholesale digital currency connectivity with international partners to improve the efficiency in cross-border foreign exchange settlement and successful interlinking with diverse DLT and non-DLT financial networks in the future. Its focus includes the study of business models and governance structures for cross-border foreign exchange settlement, the development of technical standards and infrastructure for cross-border connectivity, interoperability and atomic settlement, and the establishment of policy guidelines for digital currency infrastructure connectivity across borders.
“The Cedar x Ubin+ experiment envisages a future digital currency landscape where central banks can enable interoperability of wholesale CBDCs to facilitate more efficient cross-border payment flows including for less liquid currencies, without requiring a common infrastructure,” noted Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets & Development) at MAS"
7831,3383,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/industry-roundup-twenty-first-april,Industry roundup: 21 April,2022-04-21,,"Fitch outlines China corporates’ challenges
Near-term pressures on profitability are increasing for Chinese companies in several sectors, says Fitch Ratings in its latest assessment. Domestic and external consumer demand faces headwinds, even as supply chains within China are challenged by wide-ranging restrictions on movement designed to counter the spread of Covid-19 cases.
Citing research firm Gavekal, the ratings agency notes that a s of mid-April, pandemic-related public health restrictions affected all but 13 of China’s top 100 cities by GDP, with major regions such as Shanghai and Jilin facing full lockdowns for parts of March and April. These measures have added further challenges to policymakers’ efforts to stabilise economic momentum, after the emergence of housing-sector strains from mid-2021 that led some developers into distress.
Fitch adds that dented consumer confidence was evident in a quarterly survey released at the end of Q1 2022 by the People’s Bank of China (PBoC). This showed urban residents intended to reduce spending and investment, despite improved perceptions about household income and employment. It indicated that households intend to cut discretionary spending, focusing instead on essential items, education and healthcare. Retail sales also fell year-on-year (yoy) in March.
The agency now expects China’s retail sales growth to decelerate to mid-single digits in 2022 from 12.5% in 2021, given weaker consumer sentiment, the impact of lockdowns and the high base effect for the first half of 2022. Sectors that benefit from discretionary spending, including tourism, entertainment and luxury goods, are likely to underperform essentials. This could put pressure on the ratings of more vulnerable firms in these discretionary sectors.
Demand pressures for Chinese corporates will be aggravated by softer consumer demand in developed markets. This reflects, in part, high levels of inflation and the tightening of monetary policy - in contrast to trends in China, where consumer price inflation remains low - as well as a normalisation of demand patterns after the surge in goods purchases during the pandemic. China’s goods export growth slowed to 15.8% yoy in Q1 2022, from 29.9% in full-year 2021.
These pressures have been accompanied in recent weeks by an increase in supply chain problems associated with movement restrictions. Several companies have reportedly halted production owing to difficulties in transporting inputs and finished products"
7832,3383,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/industry-roundup-twenty-first-april,Industry roundup: 21 April,2022-04-21,,"China’s goods export growth slowed to 15.8% yoy in Q1 2022, from 29.9% in full-year 2021.
These pressures have been accompanied in recent weeks by an increase in supply chain problems associated with movement restrictions. Several companies have reportedly halted production owing to difficulties in transporting inputs and finished products. Fitch expects manufacturers with long supply chains - such as automotive, aerospace and consumer technology firms - to be more exposed to this issue. Effects on output may prove temporary (and recoverable) if the authorities succeed in containing Covid-19 cases, but the agency believes there is a risk that disruption could continue for months as new outbreaks emerge and are suppressed.
Subdued consumer sentiment has impeded companies’ ability to pass on higher input costs. Consumer price inflation has been below producer price inflation, in yoy terms, since January 2021, suggesting that downstream corporates are absorbing higher upstream costs. This may have adverse effects on their profitability, and in turn on their standalone creditworthiness. However, this impact could be offset by other factors, such as reducing capex due to the weaker demand outlook. Moreover, exporters have been better able to raise prices, passing on higher costs to overseas customers.

Higher commodity prices should be broadly credit positive for upstream industrial corporates, Fitch concludes. In February profits among large mining and quarrying firms rose by 132% yoy while those of manufacturers dropped by 4.2%. Weak consumer sentiment may prompt the government to accelerate counter-cyclical policy support, notably in infrastructure investment. This would likely skew activity further towards heavy industry and upstream industrial corporates, at least in the near term.
European corporates “gain €3.8bn from commodities hedging”
Hedges amassed in 2021 provide a €3.8 billion (US$4.15bn) relief to European automobile and consumer goods multinationals reports EuroFinance, but it warns that protection will fade as hedges expire and costs of new ones catch up with today’s prices.
EuroFinance calculates that the recent surge in commodity prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, means that major corporates such as Nestle, BMW, VW and Anheuser-Busch are sitting on a market-to-market (mtm) gain of €3.8 billion from commodity hedges added last year, according to analysis of filings"

The hedging gain removes some of the pain of an estimated €15 billion increase in raw material costs experienced by the companies.
“These risk management actions by treasurers provided a much-needed buffer to corporates as they deployed operational strategies including pricing, higher procurement, operating leverage and efficiencies programs to mitigate a sustained rise in input prices,” it adds.
In the case of Nestle, the Swiss food and drink conglomerate held notional commodity hedges worth CHF2.55 billion (€2.45 billion) at the end of 2021, 190% or €1.6 billion higher than last year. These derivatives locked in prices of its future purchases of green coffee, cocoa beans, cereals and grains, which when expressed as a proportion of cost of goods sold equated to 5.6% in 2021.  Based on the current spot prices of commodities consumed by Nestle, EuroFinance estimates these hedges to yield a €493 million mtm gain. 
Germany’s auto manufacturer BMW also followed suit with a 57% or €1.87 billion increase in notional hedges to €5.1 billion in 2021, sufficient to hedge 74% of raw material exposed to price changes in key metals including aluminium, copper, nickel, platinum and palladium. While the average price at which BMW locked in hedges has gone up by 56%, EuroFinance estimates the year-to-date mtm gain to be €1.18 billion. “Good news is that commodities are hedged to a very high degree for 2022.” said Nicolas Peter, CFO at BMW. 
However, the report warns that despite the mark to market gains, hedging is only a stopgap solution. “As contracts expire, they will be replaced by new transactions struck at today’s high prices,” EuroFinance comments. “Other tools for commodity risk management are necessary, such as supply chain or procurement, where corporates are deploying other operational strategies to fight inflation in the coming quarters"

Citi recycles plastic for corporate cards
Citi has introduced recycled PVC (rPVC) for its corporate cards and says that the rollout will start in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region, before being distributed globally.
The rPVC cards will be produced from recycled industrial plastic material that typically comes from industries such as printing and packaging. The cards will go through an open loop recycling process, meaning old products are transformed into new products delivering a significant benefit in the reduction of industrial plastic waste.
“Every rPVC card will be made with 85% recycled industrial waste per finished card and represents a reduction in CO2 emissions during the card manufacturing process, delivering a reduction of 36% CO2 emissions in comparison to a standard PVC card,” the bank stated. “To ensure that no unnecessary wastage occurs by replacing original cards that have not yet expired, the rollout will commence in EMEA in April 2022 and will be introduced globally in a phased manner.”
Trudy Curtis, EMEA Head of Commercial Cards at Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions, added: “As a dual network issuer, we are able to offer rPVC across both Mastercard and Visa.”
Fyle offers real-time spend management for Visa credit cards
US fintech Fyle Inc, specialist in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered expense management software, has launched of a for real-time spend management solution for customers using corporate and small business cards in the US, starting with Visa.
“Fyle will be one of the first spend management platforms to offer direct and real-time transaction feeds to any Visa-powered credit card users, with direct secure enrolment from the cardholder,” said the company.
“Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, with over six million small businesses in the US"
7836,3383,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/industry-roundup-twenty-first-april,Industry roundup: 21 April,2022-04-21,,"“Fyle will be one of the first spend management platforms to offer direct and real-time transaction feeds to any Visa-powered credit card users, with direct secure enrolment from the cardholder,” said the company.
“Small businesses are the backbone of the US economy, with over six million small businesses in the US. They use business credit cards as a crucial tool in their cash management function. Yet, the experience of managing and accounting for card spending remains manual because of outdated technology from issuing banks.”
The firm – which is partnering with financial consultancy Aprio for the launch –  adds that to tackle this, new spend management start-ups are issuing their corporate cards, bypassing the banks. Benefits include real-time visibility, end-user notifications, and cash control. However, these fintechs require minimum cash balances, ranging from US$25,000 to US$250,000. These cards primarily charge cards that don’t support any balance rollover, shortening the credit period to a day or month.
“Focusing on tech-savvy and funded start-ups is a great acquisition strategy, but it addresses a small market. Card-led fintech accounts for less than 10% of the overall US$1.5 trillion commercial card spend in the US, while more than 90% of this spend happens on cards issued by leading banks.
“Instead of asking customers to switch to another business card, Fyle integrates with their existing business credit cards to give them a real-time spend management experience. The instantaneous data from card feeds and receipts are combined and made ready for accounting, vastly reducing manual work for spenders, finance teams and accounting firms.
“The implications are significant. While SMBs get sophisticated AI-enabled spend management software and the freedom to choose their business credit card, Fyle can offer their product to any business credit card without depending on the bank’s tech stack. This offers unique collaboration opportunities to comarket the solution to banks’ business customers.”
Fyle says that it is  initially launching the solution for the Visa network and will support other networks over the months ahead.

Harbor finds a berth in India
US receivables and supply chain finance (SCF) provider Harbor plans to move into India, as part of its expansion plans to roll out its offering to businesses in developing markets.
The Miami-based company is launching its India operations through a franchise partnership with Blue Ocean, a Mumbai-based asset manager and investment advisor focused on working capital and trade finance. The agreement will see Blue Ocean act as a local originator and operate under the name Habor India. The move into the Asian market follows Harbor’s recent launch in Mexico via a similar franchise arrangement with Monterrey-based firm KC2.
“In the case of Mexico and India, our local operations are managed exclusively by our franchisee that takes funding and risk participation in the trade finance programmes originated in their market. This allows for more efficient origination and risk management/due diligence with skin in the game,” said a Harbor spokesperson. “The partners leverage our branding and marketing support as well as our funding, integrated risk management system and product modules like receivables and supply chain finance.”
Harbor launched in 2018 as an SCF provider for the middle market, serving buyers in North America, Latin America and Western Europe, as well as their domestic and international suppliers, targeting smaller suppliers often overlooked by large buyers. The firm has since expanded its user base to also include suppliers in developing markets that include Greater China, Southeast Asia and South America. In the past year, Harbor has broadened its offering for supplier companies by rolling out a receivables finance product.

7839,3384,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/the-impact-of-trumponomics,The impact of Trumponomics,2016-11-17,,"Much is being written and said about how a Trump presidency will affect the US and global economy. Trump himself - on his campaign website - says he will create 25 million jobs over a decade, and boost growth to 3.5 per cent per year on average (potentially rising to 4 per cent). The media reaction has ranged from calling Trumps plans for the economy a “total disaster”, “unmodellable”, “ill-designed” and “harmful”. Here is a little overview of recent views being aired in the financial media.
Short-term economic growth but huge budget deficits
Donald Trump expects to inject $1 trillion into the US economy through infrastructure projects, during his initial period in government. This is expected to boost the economy above current growth rate of 2-2.5 per cent, according to Joel Naroff, president and founder of Naroff Economic Advisors and a former chief economist for TD Bank, who recently gave a talk at FEI’s Current Financial Reporting Issues Conference. CFO Magazine's report of the speech quotes Naroff as saying: “This is the most traditional Republican economic plan I’ve seen. Just as Reagan and Bush got stronger growth, at least for a short period of time, so will Trump.”
However, Naroff also stated that Trump's proposed tax cuts and spending increases would result in annual budget deficits for the US government of $900 million to $1.2 trillion during Trump’s first term.
Initial business uncertainty
Michelle Meyer, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) told Euromoney's Peter Lee she has shaved 50 basis points off US growth forecasts for the first half of 2017 on the basis that businesses might delay investment in an atmosphere of heightened uncertainty.
Trade tariffs
Trump also intends to renegotiate trade pacts and treaties, placing higher tariffs on goods imported from Mexico and China and reviewing NAFTA and pulling out of the as yet unapproved trans-Pacific pact (TPP). For example, he has mentioned a 35 per cent tariff on motor vehicles imported from Mexico, which has infuriated executives at Ford. CEO Mark Fields – quoted by NBC News – said that ""A tariff like that could have a huge impact on the US economy.”
Regulation
Trump wants far fewer business and financial regulations and there has been talk of dismantling the Dodd-Frank Act"

CEO Mark Fields – quoted by NBC News – said that ""A tariff like that could have a huge impact on the US economy.”
Regulation
Trump wants far fewer business and financial regulations and there has been talk of dismantling the Dodd-Frank Act. This has been widely praised by some in the financial and banking sectors. Peter J. Wallison writes in the Wall Street Journal that “The repeal or thoroughgoing reform of that destructive law is certainly a key step toward an economic recovery.” However, the idea of repealing the Dodd-Frank Act was criticised by Barney Frank, one of its co-sponsors, who told CNBC: “""If he wants to have a national debate about whether we should go back to mortgages to people who can't repay them and then securities based on those bad mortgages, I welcome it.”  See CTMfile's article on this - Will we be safe from economic melt-down if Dodd-Frank is dismantled?
Post-truth economy?
Euromoney's Lee argues that it's almost futile to try to predict Trump himself and how the economy could pan out under his leadership. Trump's election win means that everything is now unpredictable. He quotes Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS Wealth Management, as saying: “This is the return of political economics. We have to realise that random events, random shocks, will come in. The very mathematical approach economics has taken in the past is one we must move away from in analysing the economy in future.”
Deportating immigrants = economic contraction
Undocumented workers are estimated to number around 8 million in the US in total, although Trump has said he will deport 3 million people. The majority of undocumented workers in the US work in leisure, hospitality and construction – although up to 1 million also work in professional and business services. Max Ehrenfreund writes in the Chicago Tribune that the deportation of such a large part of the workforc could lead to a reduction of agricultural production by 9 per cent and declines of 8 per cent in construction and leisure and hospitality over the long term. He adds that manufacturing output could decline by $74 billion over the long term, “followed by somewhat more modest declines in wholesale and retail trade and financial activities”"

He adds that manufacturing output could decline by $74 billion over the long term, “followed by somewhat more modest declines in wholesale and retail trade and financial activities”. Ehrenfreund, quoting two economic experts, adds: “Undocumented workers are responsible for about 3 per cent of the US economy overall. Deporting all of them would result in a substantial contraction”.
15% corporate tax rate
Bond investor Bill Gross, who manages the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, told Fox Business he believes lowering the corporate tax rate to 15 per cent is “unnecessary”, saying: “Yes, we have a 35% marginal tax rate but really an effective 24, 23% tax rate that’s amongst the lowest in the world.”"
7842,3385,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/what-can-virtual-accounts-do-for-you,What can virtual accounts do for you?,2019-01-18,,"The next generation of virtual accounts improve visibility, control and centralisation of receivables management, according to HSBC's senior commercialisation manager, Liquidity and Investments, Timothy Bartlett. So-called virtual accounts are a way to manage incoming payments from customers or subsidiaries by using unique account numbers or identifiers to sort or allocate the receivables, while the payment is visible and manageable from the company's main physical account. This allows the accounts receivable team to see exactly who has paid, which is a great benefit.
But the use of virtual accounts among corporates isn't as widespread as one might suppose. This article published by iTreasurer explains why some corporate treasurers are not completely convinced. Drawing on comments from a NeuGroup European Treasurers’ Peer Group meeting, held at the end of last year, the qualms noted by iTreasurer include a problem with the term 'virtual account', with some preferring to call the structure a subaccount. Other concerns are more concrete, such as the tax and audit implications of virtual accounts in some jurisdictions, as well as the know your customer (KYC) requirements for virtual accounts covering multiple legal entities.
In an article earlier this month, HSBC's Bartlett claims that his bank's next-generation virtual accounts offer the corporate treasurer several benefits:

There is easier administration for the corporate, who can request a virtual account allocation through HSBCnet. The bank still has to carry out the full KYC process on the legal account holder and due diligence has to be done on different entities holding virtual accounts.
The payments and receivables “on behalf of” model (Pobo/Robo) is offered. Bartlett writes: “The segregation provided by the virtual accounts ensures traceability and transparency, while at the same time simplifying the process of making payments under a POBO model.”
Virtual accounts also give the treasury good cash visibility and can provide liquidity management in a similar way to notional pooling. But unlike notional pooling, virtual accounts create a net intercompany position.
Bartlett adds that the cost of a virtual account is lower than for a normal, physical bank account: “As they are actually ledger records, not real bank accounts, the costs associated with operating them are lower than for physical accounts.”

Citi also announced a new virtual accounts products for corporate clients last year"

Citi also announced a new virtual accounts products for corporate clients last year.
However, it seems that not all corporate treasurers are comfortable with the idea of virtual accounts and perhaps, in some jurisdictions and circumstances, the benefits of better receivables management are outweighed by concerns over KYC and audit/tax trails. Interestingly, iTreasurer writes that the corporate treasurers who were in favour of virtual accounts tended to deploy them in smaller markets and developing countries. Despite the progress banks like HSBC and Citi are making, virtual accounts might continue to have their greatest practical application in select circumstances and smaller markets"
7844,3386,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/62-of-otc-trades-centrally-cleared-bis-surveys,62% of OTC trades centrally cleared – BIS surveys,2016-11-11,,"More dealers are clearing over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives through central counterparties (CCPs) but central clearing is far less common for other types of OTC trades, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).
The results of the BIS semiannual and triennial surveys of outstanding OTC derivatives positions show that three-quarters of dealers report clearing OTC interest-rate derivatives contracts through CCPs in the first half of 2016. This compares with 37 per cent for credit derivatives and less than 2 per cent for OTC foreign exchange and equity derivatives.
The surveys found that, overall, 62 per cent of the $544 trillion-worth of notional amounts outstanding were centrally cleared.
According to the BIS, this is the first time these periodic surveys have captured comprehensive data on positions with central counterparties (CCPs).
The BIS reported also found that:

The gross market value of outstanding OTC derivatives (in other words, the “cost of replacing all outstanding contracts at current market prices”) rose to $20.7 trillion at the end of June 2016 (compared to $14.5 trillion at the end of 2015).
The gross market value of foreign exchange derivatives involving the yen and pound sterling more than doubled in the first half of 2016, on the back of sharp moves in the respective currencies.
The vast majority (94 per cent) of outstanding positions in OTC derivatives markets are concentrated among major dealers from 13 countries. The BIS stated: “Of the $544 trillion in notional amounts outstanding at end-June 2016, $512 trillion (94 per cent) was reported by dealers from the 13 countries that participate in the BIS semiannual survey, and $32 trillion by dealers that participate only in the BIS Triennial Survey.”"
7845,3387,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/report-predicts-top-10-market-structure-trends-for-2020,Top 10 market structure trends for 2020,2020-01-07,,"The centre of gravity for financial institutions continued shifting toward technology in 2019. Trust and human interactions still matter a great deal, but even in those corners of the market where deals are done over the phone, the role of technology is pervasive. While people want to talk to people, they increasingly only want to talk to those people with the best technology by their side.
A new report from Greenwich Associates expects these trends to continue in 2020, but US politics and Brexit will increasingly take centre stage, in the report’s biggest market structure trends to watch in 2020:
1. The next US president and Brexit impact markets, one way or the other
The world is more polarised than ever, with evidence of the ideological split dominating market headlines and Main Street conversations on both sides of the Atlantic. It remains unclear whether the election for prime minister in the UK and forthcoming Brexit decisions foreshadow what is to come in the US in November 2020. What the report makes clear, however, is that political debating among Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Mike Bloomberg, and President Trump about a wealth tax, financial transaction tax and trade tariffs will bring volatility to markets before, during and after the US election.
2. Markets decide the real fate of Libor
Market participants finally paid attention to the Libor transition in 2019. Now that those who will be most impacted by this change are considerably more informed, the discussion will get increasingly nuanced, making a path forward more clear. The Greenwich report does not expect a ‘big bang’ move away from Libor, despite banks knowing the date they will no longer be required to contribute prices. It also does not expect there to be a single Libor replacement. SOFR, EONIA and SONIA have the support of local governments, but none is a perfect replacement. The reality is that different things need different benchmarks. Should a residential mortgage and a billion dollar swap contract be tied to the same benchmark, for instance? This transition will be painful, but it’s for the best.
3. FX investors gain transparency
With the electronification of FX markets having possibly plateaued, there is increasing competition among venues. Venues are now competing with one another, rather than trying to peel volume away from voice transactions - a much more difficult process. In the coming year, the report suggests there will be an increase in the adoption and utilisation of transaction cost analysis (TCA) to quantify and systematise that process"

With the electronification of FX markets having possibly plateaued, there is increasing competition among venues. Venues are now competing with one another, rather than trying to peel volume away from voice transactions - a much more difficult process. In the coming year, the report suggests there will be an increase in the adoption and utilisation of transaction cost analysis (TCA) to quantify and systematise that process. The increased utilisation of API aggregators to access multiple liquidity sources creates a tournament among the venues, which provides a more complete picture of the market against which to judge them. This will drive market participants to seek out better and more actionable analytics to drive order-routing decisions in 2020.
4. Unclear margin requirements drive new market dynamics
In 2019, the authorities revised the Uncleared Margin Rules (UMR) implementation timeline, pushing the final phase for firms with US$8bn in gross notional of bilateral derivatives out to September 2021 from 2020. This delay was necessary because determining whether a firm is in scope and deciding how to mitigate its effects are both complex processes. Many on the buy side were and will be surprised at the increase in costs associated with certain instruments and strategies that will now require posting initial margin to third-party custodians. Financial market infrastructure providers will compete to offer advice and solutions to these firms but, in the end, UMR will drive the biggest change in the OTC derivatives markets since the implementation of mandatory clearing.
5. Spending on regtech peaks as budgets are cut and automation takes over
Peak compliance technology spending in the face of shrinking compliance budgets might seem counterintuitive, but this dichotomy will nonetheless dominate the 2020 regtech conversation, according to the report. Regulations have tightened, enforcement continues to increase, and heightened public scrutiny carries evermore dire consequences to reputational risk. Consequently, firms can no longer ignore the need for proactive regtech investments. Monitoring trading and related activities has been a growing priority for market participants during the last decade, with spending on specialised solutions surpassing US$1bn.
Yet as the financial industry enters the 2020s, many firms still have not maximised full efficacy and cost efficiency in their surveillance infrastructures. Solutions offerings are more diverse than ever, and underlying technology boasts advancements such as natural language processing, machine learning and other AI components"

Solutions offerings are more diverse than ever, and underlying technology boasts advancements such as natural language processing, machine learning and other AI components. Firms may be pulling back the reigns on compliance budgets, but many are doing so by taking a more proactive approach toward technology investment in lieu of personnel expenditures.
“Financial firms can no longer ignore the need for proactive regtech investments,” says Dan Connell, managing director of Greenwich Associates Market Structure and Technology. “The coming year will be a race against further budget reductions and see toughening competition among vendors - but the market will be better for it.”
6. Zero commissions in US equity markets change market dynamics
US equity commissions have been on a downward trend for both institutional and retail clients since at least the mid-1970s, culminating in zero-commission trading for retail investors in 2019. Led initially by robo advisors such as Robinhood and Firstrade, Interactive Brokers was the first mainstream broker to throw down the zero-commission gauntlet. Quickly on the heels of that move, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity and Schwab lowered their commissions to zero, and several bank trading platforms made similar if somewhat less sweeping changes.
Unsurprisingly, the report notes that the move to zero-commission trading negatively impacted TD Ameritrade’s stock, which played a part in Charles Schwab buying the firm. The report states that further consolidation is likely, as the players try to expand, with economies of scale keeping the retail brokerage business viable. The zero-commission environment will also drive further regulatory (and customer) focus on best executions. Sure, the service is free, but expectations for better services despite lower (and in this case no) fees will only continue to grow.
7. The ETF Rule puts afterburners on the ETF market

7. The ETF Rule puts afterburners on the ETF market
SEC Rule 6c-11- the ETF Rule - was put into effect while many exchange-traded fund (ETF) market participants were gearing up for a long winter break. The new rule allows open-ended ETFs (as well as index ETFs and transparent, actively managed ETFs) that meet certain conditions to come directly to the market without having to seek exemptive relief (as has been the case for over 27 years). Previously, seeking the required SEC exemptive relief cost issuers upward of US$500,000 (the more complex, the more expensive). That’s all set to change. In 2020, the report notes that ETFs will go from conception to listing in a fraction of the time.
The report also notes that the cost of running an ETF is not inconsequential, so even with a simplified regulatory process, failure is an option. Consequently, a jump in new ETF issues will also create a jump in new ETF failures. Nevertheless, Greenwich believes there will be a wave of ETFs that take advantage of this newfound ability to come to market much more cheaply, raising the number of ETFs beyond their already sky-high levels. As has been proven already, the knock-on effect for options and underlying cash markets (i.e. corporate bonds) should be equally positive.
8. Meaningful automation comes to fixed income markets
Electronic trading levels have been the metric of choice for innovation in fixed-income trading over the past several years. Absolute volume traded through electronic channels- request-for-quote, order book, direct streams - most certainly still matters and increased by over US$2bn a day in US corporate bond markets in 2019. But that narrow definition does not capture true progress in these quickly evolving markets.
Investors began widely adopting automated trading tools in 2019, and measuring their growth in the coming years will be incredibly important to understanding market structure changes. Furthermore, electronification of processes on the trading desk other than the execution itself - salespeople deciding whom to call, more efficient capital allocation, for example - will happen more quickly and have a greater impact on the market’s functioning going forward.

9. Data scientists become the new quants
Around the turn of the century, programmers started finding their way onto the trading desk. Over the course of the following decade, those programmers morphed into quants who spent less time on cool user interfaces and more time on trading algorithms and market-prediction models. The report says it is becoming clear that the early part of the 2020s will see data scientists take over those seats on the desk. Data scientists aren’t actually kicking out quants and programmers. Data scientist is the new name for someone expert in programming, quantitative analysis and (of course) data. One could argue that most if not all of the market’s evolution over the past decade has come because of access to data and the ability to put it to work. So it should come as no surprise that those expert in doing just that are taking over.
“One could argue that most if not all of the market’s evolution over the past decade has come because of access to data and the ability to put it to work,” says Kevin McPartland, head of Research in Greenwich Associates Market Structure and Technology group. “So it should come as no surprise that experts in that field are taking over.”
10. Financial advisors don’t get replaced by robo advisors
Automation and technology have changed the face of wealth management, but wealth management will continue to have a face. Our data continues to show that investors of all wealth levels trust people more than they trust technology and would rather put the fate of their investment account with someone they can actually talk to. Somewhat paradoxically, however, advisors who provide not only sound advice but also the latest ‘wealthtech’ are trusted even more.
“Even when the ultimate decision is made by the humans involved, technology provides an unparalleled level of transparency into a portfolio - what’s been bought, sold, how often, and for how much,” says Kevin McPartland"

In other chapters they consider the increasing relevance of stablecoins and the potential of CBDCs. The top six stablecoins by market capitalisation reached a combined value of US$115bn and settled US$2.8trn of transactions in the first half of 2021, according to the report. The introduction of CBDCs is regarded as a question of ""when"" rather than ""if"". The report notes that governments and regulators globally have stepped up efforts to limit usage of digital assets, as adoption and use have increased. Among the key issues that both appear to be focused on revolve around anti- money laundering (AML) and know your client (KYC), mitigating potential bank runs, taxation and liability.

""We are optimistic about the long-term growth of this segment as it matures and regulatory uncertainty is clarified.” Throughout the report, regulatory risk is identified as the main obstacle to growth in the near-term.

The Survey of Corporate Responsibility Reporting 2017 found that only eight of the 94 largest Danish companies acknowledge climate change as a financial risk to be included in the annual accounts. But the consultancy firm said the situation isn't just a Danish one; a quarter of international companies are also failing to report on the financial risk to the bottom line related to extreme weather events such as flooding, drought and hurricanes. The report states: “If companies do not acknowledge the financial risks of climate change, they risk losing investors and the opportunity to cope with the negative consequences they cause.” It adds that the failure to disclose climate-related risks and the potential impacts on products and services leaves investors unaware of how risky their investments really are. As a result, pressure is growing on companies to include climate-related financial risks in their annual reports.
75% of firms issue CR reports
The report included data from 4,900 of the largest companies worldwide, and the main findings suggest that 75 per cent of these companies do not report on climate-related risks. In Denmark, more than 90% of the 94 largest companies do not report on climate-related risks.
Some of the key findings of the survey include:

around three-quarters of the companies in the survey issue corporate responsibility (CR) reports;
most of the world’s biggest companies now integrate financial and non-financial data in their annual financial reports (78 per cent), suggesting they believe CR information is relevant for investors;
Latin America has seen a surge in CR reporting in the past two years, driven by regulation, foreign investor demand and the need to build and protect public trust;
integrated reporting has taken off in Japan, Brazil, Mexico and Spain;
the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) remains the most popular framework for CR reporting. Around two-thirds of reports analysed in this survey apply the GRI G4 Guidelines or Standards.

The digital solution, initially being applied to custody FX transactions in Korean Won, aims to reduce the pre-trade lifecycle to seconds from hours, minimising the operational burden and manual intervention that can be prevalent in emerging-market custody FX.
The solution is already live in Korea, with the Indonesian Rupiah and the Indian Rupee targeted next. Subsequently, it will be progressively rolled out to a broad range of restricted currencies, which are linked to investors’ underlying equity or fixed-income transactions.
Leveraging existing bots between the two banks for instantaneous communication to help eliminate market frictions, the solution can also bring trade remediation closer to the time of execution. The resulting benefits can also reduce price slippage for clients between the FX leg of a transaction and the equity or fixed-income security trade.
Digital innovation in FX markets is accelerating in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, because securities denominated in those currencies are increasingly being included - or more heavily weighted - in emerging market indices and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
“We are constantly looking at ways to introduce cutting-edge technology for the benefit of our clients,"" said Jason Vitale, global head of FX at BNY Mellon. ""With this partnership, we are not only seizing an opportunity to alter back-office processing in restricted markets, but more importantly, we are providing front-office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency.”

""This demonstrates our commitment to market leading execution, at a time when investor participation and focus on costs in these markets are increasing.

The multi-year transformation and optimisation of the bank’s current systems will take place in a phased approach. Both parties say they are committed to compliance with privacy and data protection regulation to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of customer data and Deutsche Bank’s information assets.
With this partnership, Deutsche Bank will also gain direct access to data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning to better serve customers. Potential use cases include helping treasury clients with day-to-day tasks such as cash flow forecasting, improved risk analytics, and advanced security solutions to protect clients’ accounts. For the private banking business, digital and intuitive solutions will be the focus, to simplify the interactions between customers and employees.
“The partnership with Google Cloud will be an important driver of our strategic transformation,” commented Christian Sewing, CEO of Deutsche Bank. “It demonstrates our determination to invest in our technology as our future is strongly linked to successful digitisation. It is as much a revenue story as it is about costs.”
The decision follows intensive discussions and due diligence over the past five months. In February 2020, Deutsche Bank invited a number of major cloud service providers to propose a partnership as part of its multi-vendor cloud strategy. As part of this strategy, the bank will continue to work closely with its existing technology partners"

The remit of group, which was first announced by BIS Governors in May, is to bolster code of conduct standards and principles in foreign exchange markets.The working group operates with oversight from the Markets Committee, the BIS's forum for monitoring developments in financial markets and assessing their implications for central banks.Guy Debelle, from the Reserve Bank of Australia, and Chairman of the Markets Committee, will head the FXWG. He said: “A single, global common code of conduct is a necessary goal for the FX industry. The code will be principles-based ‒ rather than rules-based ‒ and will provide guidance on what is, as well as what is not, appropriate behaviour for practitioners in the FX market.”The group's main objectives are to build upon work done by regional foreign exchange committees to drive development of a single global code for the FX market, while also engaging a broader set of regions in the process.According to the BIS, progress towards the development of the code will be shared publicly as the work takes place.

You are only as good as the quality and depth of your corporate treasury team. Using the latest technology and systems is all very well, but unless you have superb people who really understand your business - both the treasury aspects AND also the way your company functions and its key drivers - your department may be efficient, but they will make poor decisions. In the age of internet and seamlessly inter-connected systems and services, the need for excellent pro-active and innovative staff has never been greater.
In this Top 10 items list Adam Gordon, CEO of Social Media Search and his team, list the 10 things you have to do to be attractive to the very best.

Inspire your team - get everyone involved

Encourage your team to interact with company content and with each other online, and to share their experiences positively on social media.


Build an excellent company profile

Make use of the company page function on LinkedIn so that there is always a neat link between you and your employer. A well populated, accurate and dynamic company profile will support the efforts of your personal profile and further establish talent brand online.


Optimise your personal profile

LinkedIn profiles can seem incredibly overwhelming; however, they are easily optimized for maximum effect. Adding key words to your professional headline and having a clear headshot are two ways you can quickly make a huge difference. 


Create thorough content calendars

Posting a constant stream of content can seem really unachievable, however with a bit of planning, updating your social media should be a breeze. Content calendars can be pulled together in a spreadsheet and allow you to set out what you would like to post each day. An app like Buffer offers a good free option that will allow you to schedule and automate the posting of your content.


Identify your total addressable market

A solid profile and stellar content calendar mean nothing if they aren’t reaching the right audience. Think about who you would want to hire and pull together a list of people you could approach to connect with.


Take your relationships offline

You have pulled together a great list and have dozens of suitable candidates that have accepted your LinkedIn connection requests – now what? LinkedIn allows you to export your contacts in to a .csv file, along with their email addresses, so you can continue the conversation"

Consider your talent brand

How a brand is constructed has been lifted by social media from the hands of the employer and put in the hands of the talent – both potential and current employees. Taking steps to improve your online presence is already taking your talent brand in to consideration. 


Use useful tools

Chrome extensions are a great way to boost your online experience and help with building connections. For example, Hunter is great for finding email addresses. 


Be aware of your audience

When pulling together your content calendar keep in mind the hot topics for your target audience, and tailor to their interests and needs.


Test, Monitor, Adapt – Better & Better

Keep an eye on how your posts are performing so you can ensure you are always publishing content that your followers are engaging with.

What could be some of the consequences of this?
Gerard Hergenroeder, of IBM, argues in this blogpost on Finextra that “the repeal of Dodd-Frank will create a flurry of innovation in the US”. He says that 'banking leaders' will then be free to innovate on revenue-generating products, by shifting the resources they currently give to compliance (up to 50 per cent of IT budget, according to Hergenroeder) into these new innovative areas. Making the outlandish claim that “banking will become fun again”, Hergenroeder predicts that banks will rebuild their ageing infrastructure, helped by fintechs.
Banking fun?
So what kind of fun does Mr Hergenroeder envisage will return to banking? Is he referring to the kind of 'fun' that gave us the selling of sub-prime mortgages in the US in the years leading up to the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers? Some might say that banking is not meant to be fun and most would prefer a bank to behave responsibly and safely.
Do we need Dodd-Frank?
Just as a quick recap, Dodd-Frank – full name Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 2010 – was designed to tackle the weaknesses in the US banking system that caused the banking crisis in 2007 and 2008 (and then spread to Europe necessitating huge bank bailouts). Although the final 2,300-page Act consisted of 16 titles, it had several overarching aims:

to consolidate regulatory agencies;
financial markets regulation, including increased transparency and of derivatives contracts;
measures for increased consumer protection;
enabling bankrupt firms to be wound down in an orderly way;
increased regulation of credit rating agencies and improved accounting practices; and
prohibiting depository banks from proprietary trading (the Volker rule, similar to the Glass-Steagall Act)"
7861,3393,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/will-we-be-safe-from-economic-melt-down-if-dodd-frank-is-dismantled,Will we be safe from economic melt-down if Dodd-Frank is dismantled?,2016-11-15,,"So do we need this Act? Does it not protect consumers and improve the stability in the financial system, preventing banks that are 'too big to fail'? This is the legislation's stated intent: “To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ""too big to fail"", to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for other purposes”
Will consumers be protected?
One of the regulators created under Dodd-Frank that is likely to come under fire from the Trump administration is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which oversees protection of consumers in areas including home finance, student loans, credit cards and banking practices. According to the Financial Times, the CFPB is far from popular with banks and is likely to face “persistent political pressure”. However, dismantling consumer protection would go against the grain of Trump's populist “for the people” narrative. Nonetheless, US banks could be allowed to operate with less compliance, fewer KYC checks and fewer constraints on lending.
A mess and a bad law?
And there are many voices in the financial media who seem to be quite thrilled at the idea of a watered-down version of Dodd-Frank. Tim Worstall, writing in Forbes, says: “Dodd Frank is both a mess and bad law. Good grief, it even contains some ideas from Elizabeth Warren which is taking broadmindedness in the pursuit of public policy to unfathomable extremes. Repeal it, get rid of it.” Worstall advocates tackling the main problem as he sees it, which is the “too big to fail” banks through taxation, which he says has worked in the UK's bank levy.
However, while Trump's transition team have blamed the law for sluggish economic growth, there is the possibility that the slow growth of recent years can be traced back to the 2008 financial crisis, the causes of which Dodd-Frank was enacted to eliminate. Despite the transition team's claims that the law “doesn't work for the people”, there seem to be quite strong indicators that the effects of Dodd-Frank are primarily to protect us from financial wrong-doing and the risk of having to pick up the pieces (and the bill) following another financial disaster such as the 2008 bailouts"

This is according to EY's Global Fraud Survey, now in its 15th consecutive year.
The report was based on 2,550 interviews conducted in the local language with senior decision-makers (CFOs, CCOs, general counsel and heads of internal audit) in a sample of the largest companies in 55 countries.
It found that:

the scale of bribery and corruption has shown no improvement globally since 2012;
overall, 38 per cent of the executives said corruption occurs widely in business – but this figure varies from 20 per cent in developed countries to 52 per cent in emerging markets;
this means that levels of bribery and corruption in emerging markets are more than double that of developed markets;
20 per cent of respondents under the age of 35 would justify cash payments to win or retain business;
corruption risks in some regions is higher than the global average: Central and Eastern Europe (47 per cent), the Middle East (62 per cent) and Latin America (74 per cent).

Tackling corruption take time
The report also found that improved anti-corruption legislation and more active enforcement does not always have an immediate effect and there can be a time-lag in seeing reduced levels of corruption as a result of legislation and enforcement. Three countries that have shown this trend, according to the report, are Brazil, the UK and the Netherlands. The report states: “Brazil, for example, has seen the introduction of legislation and increased enforcement over the last four years. Yet, 96 per cent of Brazilian respondents indicate that corrupt practices occur widely in business – an increase from 80 per cent in 2014 when the new laws were introduced. In the US, however, where enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) intensified in the mid-2000s, perceived levels of corruption fell this year to 18 per cent, an improvement from 22 per cent in 2014.”
Also highlighted is the importance of internal penalties for corruption within companies, as 78 per cent of respondents believe their organisations have the clear intent of penalising misconduct, but only 57 per cent are aware of people having actually been punished"

Daunting challenge
EY's Andrew Gordon said: “The lack of improvement in global levels of corruption over the last six years shows that unethical behaviour in business remains a daunting challenge, despite intensified global enforcement. While corruption remains so prevalent, businesses remain vulnerable to significant financial and reputational harm. Management teams must identify and address the root causes of unethical conduct in their organization. Compliance programs need to keep pace with the impact of rapid technological advancements and the increasingly complex risk environment on business operations. More robust risk management should be considered a strategic means of improving business performance.”
Top 15: Executive perceptions of bribery/corruption practices by country


CTMfile take: The EY Global Fraud Survey has some shocking results, suggesting that corruption and bribery in business continue despite increased regulation and enforcement. It emphasises the importance of internal organisational procedures for deterring corruption and fraud, as well as the necessity of monitoring third-party risks"

According to a white paper – How to Instantly Boost Profitability Invoice Automation – published by Supply&DemandChain Executive in December 2015, of the 500 billion invoices issued globally last year, only 42 billion were paperless. This suggests that more than 90 per cent of companies are still incurring the higher costs and inefficiencies associated with issuing paper invoices, from opening mail, to data input and manual verification, all of which are expensive and prone to errors.Electronic or automated invoicing can enable companies to benefit from dynamic discounting and avoid late penalties, while the cost of manual labour to process one invoice is US$15. These factors make it an imperative for finance departments – particularly those with oversight for accounts payable (AP) – to explore how invoice automation can cut costs and resources.The Supply&DemandChain Executive white paper lists five ways that invoice automation can instantly boost profits: Ensure you don't miss out on early payment discounts or late payment penalties. According to the white paper, up to 60 per cent of early payment discounts are missed and 12 per cent of payments are late due to inefficient manual payment practices. Avoid duplicate payments. Duplicate invoice payments can cost companies as much as $100,000 for every $10 million spent. Processing a paper invoice manually can take staff an average of 27 days, which is part of the reason why many invoices are paid late. Automating the AP process means receiving and entering supplier invoices 75 per cent faster than traditional paper-based methods. Manual data entry offers an accuracy rate of 70 per cent, compared to 100 per cent accurate data capture with invoice automation. Manually processing invoices costs an average of US$15 per invoice, compared to US$3 when invoicing is automated. This means a reduction of administration and transactional costs by up to 80 per cent"

Reports show that the UK has the highest rate of bank card fraud in Europe, with over 80% committed using stolen card information. According to the SMF's analysis of European Central Bank data figures, there were 134 card frauds per 1,000 people in the UK in 2019. Card fraud cost the UK more than £8,800 per 1,000 people. Card-not-present fraud, in which a criminal uses card details without the physical card, accounted for 84% of all card fraud in the UK. These criminals employ advanced methods to obtain payment card information, such as malware and phishing scams. Reports also noted comparisons to Germany, which had only 15 card frauds per 1,000 people, while France had 115, Spain had 37, and Italy had 19. Additionally, card fraud cost Germany just under £2,000 per 1,000 people, France £6,000, Spain £2,300, and Italy £965. The Crime Survey for England and Wales stated that there were 2.3 million bank and card frauds between April 2021 and March 2022, accounting for 51% of total recorded frauds committed against residents during that timeframe.

Reports indicate that the loan, issued by Avaya Holdings Corp., has dropped nearly 30 cents on the dollar last week after the company lowered its quarterly revenue and earnings forecasts and ousted the CEO. Investors who purchased the company's US $350 million incremental first-lien leveraged loan have hired law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld to explore their options. According to reports, some holders of the company's other first-lien loans have also joined the group. Avaya, a provider of communications software and services that competes with Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft Corp., was not an easy sell in the leveraged loan market. The company needed to raise funds in order to refinance convertible bonds due in 2023 that were significantly out-of-date. As stated by reports, investors rejected a proposed $500 million leveraged loan, forcing the company to split the issuance into a smaller loan and $250 million of privately placed exchangeable notes, both secured on a first-lien basis. In order to close the deal, Avaya agreed to raise the loan's interest rate to 10% above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (the highest margin of the year), include an upfront fee, and add other investor safeguards, reports added. On 24 June, reports indicate that JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs priced the debt, and a new investor – Brigade Capital Management – purchased $125 million of the new exchangeable notes in July, while multiple investors purchased the rest. Avaya reportedly cut its third-quarter adjusted earnings forecast by more than 60%, to between $50 million and $55 million, less than a month later, on 28 July. It also reduced its revenue forecast by more than 16%. Even more concerning to some investors is the departure of Avaya's CEO, James Chirico. Hiring a new CEO typically takes weeks or months, prompting some to wonder why the company did not disclose the transition during the June debt offering. According to various sources, the news caused Avaya's new term loan to fall to quotes in the 60s on Tuesday, from around 89 to 90 cents on the dollar. Its stock and other debt were also down"

Pedro Borges, co-founder and CEO, CriptoLoja, a Portuguese cryptocurrency exchange based in Lisbon, stated that Portugal's largest listed bank, Banco Comercial Portugues, and Banco Santander, closed all CriptoLoja accounts last week following the account closures by two small Portuguese banks, claiming that no official justification was given by the lenders. This year has also seen the closure of at least two other cryptocurrency exchanges in Portugal. Executives of Mind the Coin and of Luso Digital Assets have stated that they have had some of their accounts closed or have been unable to open accounts for months. Because of its 0% taxation on digital currency gains and low living costs, the southern European country became a haven for crypto during the pandemic. However, with large lenders expressing concerns about the sector's anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations, cryptocurrency companies around the world have struggled to open and keep bank accounts. Banco Comercial stated that it is its responsibility to alert the appropriate authorities whenever it notices questionable transactions, which may result in the termination of banking accounts with specific businesses. In addition, Banco Santander commented that it must act in accordance with its risk perception, and that any choice to keep an account open is dependent on a number of variables. The exchange must now be managed using accounts outside of Portugal, according to Borges, whose business was the first to be granted a license by the central bank in Portugal in 2021. Furthermore, Borges claims that CriptoLoja had always alerted authorities to suspicious activity and that all compliance and reporting requirements had been met. Reports show that it is unclear whether any other crypto companies have had their accounts closed this year. Still, the moves are said to affect three out of five virtual coin exchanges that have a central bank license, signalling a difficult digital-assets sector in Portugal"

According to reports, Beams intends to build a concentrated portfolio of a dozen fintech companies in a market (India) currently valued at $80 billion and expected to reach $250 billion by 2030. Beams is said to be supported by Venture Catalysts, which has nine unicorns and a $120 million early-stage accelerator fund in its portfolio. Anuj Golecha, Co-founder and Partner, Beams, commented that the fintech opportunity in India is vast – it is the only tech segment in India that has created over $80 billion in value and $8 billion in M&As. Beams' founders stated that they returned 90x to investors on the BharatPe exit, which became a unicorn (worth $1 billion or more) in 2021, and are creating more unicorns in this space. Following this year's trade and investment agreement between the UAE and India, there are reportedly new opportunities to channel funds. Deepak Ahuja, Fintech Expert Partner, Beams, commented that the UAE plays an important role in India's tech ecosystem. Investors are not only actively investing in India, but also assisting companies in their expansion into the Middle East. ADGM and ADIO (Abu Dhabi Investment Office) have reportedly devised special incentives to encourage Indian companies to invest in the Middle East and contribute to the region's fintech ecosystem"

The companies say this will result in the largest blockchain B2B fintech platform serving the United States and Latin America. Paystand and Yaydoo both claim to provide a comprehensive suite of technology-enabled B2B solutions for automating transaction, payment, and bill collection processes. The two companies say they have created best-in-class AR/AP solutions for businesses of all sizes in the US and Latin America. The combined company, according to Jeremy Almond, CEO, Paystand, is expected to be one of the first large-scale global B2B blockchain platforms across the continent. Almond says the combined enterprise has “processed over $5 billion in payments, hired 300 new employees, and built the world's largest commercial B2B blockchain network of over 500,000 connected businesses,” and went on to say that DeFi-enabled B2B payment networks that are on-chain, such as Paystand’s and Yaydoo’s networks in the US and Mexico, can unlock transformative working capital efficiencies and make financial services fairer and more open, particularly in developing markets like LATAM. Industry disruption across borders and the use of DeFi blockchain is said to shift the balance of power away from traditional financial institutions and governments and toward buyers and sellers.

According to a recent report, Spin by Oxxo, a ready-to-use Visa debit card and app, is the company's latest attempt to integrate large retail infrastructure across Mexico with financial services. This month, the company announced that 1.6 million people had signed up for Spin. This surge in sign-ups has made Oxxo, a traditional chain of convenience stores, one of Mexico's fastest growing debit card companies. Oxxo has more users than established banks like Banco Azteca and most fintechs . Oxxo stated that customers can sign up for Spin at any of Oxxo's approximately 20,000 stores in Mexico. Customers’ accounts are accompanied by an app enabling them to initiate digital payments, transfer money, and access a points program. René Lankenau, former head of digital innovation, Mexican bank BanRegio, commented that launching a financial product can be costly, but companies like Oxxo have the scale and resources to subsidize the cost and expand faster than any fintech. FEMSA, parent company of Oxxo, was founded in 1978 as a retail experiment. The report states that thirteen million people shop at Oxxo every day. In addition to selling basic groceries, SIM cards, inexpensive phones and prepaid Netflix cards, Oxxo described their cashiers as bank tellers, enabling customers to pay utility bills, initiate bank transactions, purchase data for their phones, transfer funds and pay taxes. Reports indicate that Oxxo is not affiliated with other traditional banks to launch Spin. Oxxo paired themselves with ComproPago, a Mexican fintech start-up that enables cash payments and transfers on its platform. Christine Chang, a partner at venture capital firm Rally Cap Ventures, commented that Oxxo's advantage over other fintech products on the market is that users in Mexico still want a physical presence when choosing a financial product.

Today, Commonwealth Bank enabled 2000 retail customers to trade ten digital assets through the app as part of its pilot program. The bank stated that this move was based on internal data signifying half a million customers currently trading crypto assets. ANZ previously refused to lend to businesses using crypto in 2018. Local stablecoin issuer, Chrono Bank, stated the country's four largest institutions were not willing to provide such banking services to the company in 2020, even though the project secured the required regulatory licenses. The report indicated that Australian dollars are held in a trust to fully back A$DC at a 1:1 ratio. According to Nigel Dobson, head of ANZ's banking services, ANZ anticipates the token will be able to pave the way for more of its customers to explore digital assets. Additionally, ANZ hopes the A$DC would be listed on a local cryptocurrency exchange in the future. Transaction trading on Ethereum's mainnet is associated with high fees. ANZ plans to explore launching stablecoins on other blockchains, including Hedera Hashgraph.

Former Georgia Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili has filed a lawsuit against Credit Suisse in Bermuda and Singapore for infringing trust and enduring an $800 million loss in fraudulent trade transactions by private banker Patrice Lescaudron. Ivanishvili sought $400 million in damages in the Bermuda Supreme Court, a trial case that lasted five weeks, ending in December. According to reports, Credit Suisse issued a statement awaiting a court ruling against the bank relating to damages in excess of $500 million. The report also stated that Lescaudron was sentenced to five years prison time in Switzerland in 2018 for fraud and counterfeiting. Additionally, Lescaudron admitted he forged his customer's signatures and reallocated the funds by procuring stock without the customer's consent, causing a loss of over $150 million. Lescaudron apologized to his clients and Credit Suisse and was detained for two years. He was released in 2019 and committed suicide in 2020. Evidence from the Bermuda court illustrated that many Credit Suisse executives and managers were aware Lescaudron was in breach of the rules, but chose to ignore this because he brought about $25 million in revenue to the bank each year"

7881,3402,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/creative-treasury-could-boost-your-companys-productivity,Creative treasury could boost your company’s productivity,2017-02-22,,"Creative and treasury are two words not often uttered in the same breath, but research shows that a lack of creative thinking can hamper productivity. There is huge pressure on business leaders to make the right choices and to run operations as efficiently as possible. But this leaves very little room for experimenting with innovative processes, services or products, partly because the fear of failure is too great. It may be counter-intuitive but this fear of failure is cramping the will to innovate, which leads ultimately to a loss of productivity.
In an interview with Knowledge@Wharton, Jennifer Mueller, a professor at the University of San Diego, discusses what is stopping business executives from thinking creativity. Many of Professor Mueller's arguments are relevant to how corporate financial or treasury departments operate.
Corporate creativity-blockers
She makes several interesting points:

Creative ideas are great but all companies want to make “correct, accurate, good” decisions. The problem is there's no way of telling whether creative, new ideas will work in practice and what the results will be.
Creative ideas don’t have metrics and they are therefore “unknowable”. Mueller says: “Instead, a way to think about creativity might be better served by not thinking like a decision-maker but like an inventor figuring out and getting curious about the answer.”
New solutions/systems may seem faulty to begin with but that's part of the learning curve in any process that embraces innovative and creative ideas. Mueller points out that although solutions initially seem to fail, they ultimately change, develop and get better (she gives the example of Obamacare in the US, which had initial teething problems with its online systems).
There is huge pressure on business leaders (and the younger millennial generation) to make the correct business choices, with no margin for 'failure'. This leads to people being unwilling to experiment.
Corporates place huge focus on the “how/best” mindset, subscribing to the idea that there is one best way to do things. This is enshrined in one of the favourite corporate buzzwords of the moment: 'best practice'.
There is a definite link between lack of creativity and loss of productivity"
7882,3402,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/creative-treasury-could-boost-your-companys-productivity,Creative treasury could boost your company’s productivity,2017-02-22,,"This leads to people being unwilling to experiment.
Corporates place huge focus on the “how/best” mindset, subscribing to the idea that there is one best way to do things. This is enshrined in one of the favourite corporate buzzwords of the moment: 'best practice'.
There is a definite link between lack of creativity and loss of productivity.

Changing the mindset
To get away from the corporate mindset that values the tried-and-tested processes that deliver predictable, reliable results, Professor Mueller, who has written a book on this subject, urges corporate executives to focus a little less on metrics. Metrics can measure and benchmark established processes but they can be misleading. They can't gauge the potential of new ideas, such as a new venture or a new way of doing something. What's need to assess something new is gut instinct. She notes that looking for patterns won't help you to see the best way of doing things either: “innovative ideas don’t look like the pattern, by definition.”
Should treasury throw out 'best practice'?
Treasury isn't a role that typically requires huge amounts of creative thinking. Some might say the less the better. After all, treasury is there to mitigate company risks and ensure stable cash flows and liquidity when and where needed (among a myriad other responsibilities). And it's treasury's focus on best practice that really encapsulates the need to use efficient, established processes that deliver the best, most reliable results. Yet Professor Mueller says that best practice means “don’t change” and “do what everybody else is doing”. In treasury, embracing best practice often means adopting a globalised approach and international standards – but to improve your corporate treasury processes, it will always be necessary to change and to do something that others aren't.
When creativity boosts treasury
Some areas of treasury might lend themselves more to creative thinking than others. Every company will have its own unique set of requirements and business processes relating to its supply chain, for example. These will differ according to your company's industry sector, business model and global footprint. There may not be a 'best practice' that suits your company's supply chain perfectly, so treasury will need to think creatively to find the best ways to pay, to manage communications, to manage bank relationships, to manage FX exposures, etc"

Adopting new ways of working can bring great cost benefits for companies – and can make all sorts of processes simpler, such as compliance or bank account administration. There may not yet be a 'best practice' manual on implementing such structures but you could bet on it that quite a bit of creative thinking is needed to get an innovative treasury structure in place. There may be some false starts but you can't say that some treasurers don't think creatively.

CTMfile take: Is it terribly unfair to say there's no creative thinking in the world of corporate treasury? When was the last time you used your creativity to get something new done in your treasury department? (It sounds like a bad interview question but we'd love to hear in the comments below)"

The announcement comes from the Joint Committee of the three European Supervisory Authorities (EBA, EIOPA and ESMA – ESAs) and the consultation will focus on draft guidelines on how payment service providers should detect and prevent terrorist financing and money laundering activity. This is part of the EU's programme on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT).
The guidelines stipulate that payment service providers should:

follow specific procedures to establish whether information on the payer or the payee is missing or incomplete; and
follow a procedure to manage a funds transfer that lacks the required information.

Comments can be submitted for the consultation – using the EBA's website – until 5 June 2017.
The ESA statement said that “transfers of funds can be abused for terrorist financing and money laundering purposes. To prevent such abuse, and to detect it should it occur, payment service providers must be able to establish who sends and receives these funds. European legislation, therefore, requires that specific information on payers and payees is passed on along the payment chain and makes payment service providers responsible for ensuring that this is done.”"
7885,3404,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/iasb-convinced-ifrs-16-will-create-transparency-on-leasing,IASB convinced IFRS 16 will create transparency on leasing,2016-04-01,,"IFRS 16 is an International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) issued in January this year that sets out standards for lease accounting. It will be effective from 2019 and replaces the earlier leasing standard, IAS 17.
It will affect all types of companies who use leasing arrangements – particularly sectors such as airlines, retail and shipping – and requires that all leases should be reported on the balance sheet. Currently, more than 85 per cent of leases globally are labelled as 'operating leases', so they are not recorded on the balance sheet. Leases are an important form of finance for many businesses and listed companies globally currently have $3.3 trillion-worth of leases.
Real liabilities
“Despite being off-balance sheet, there can be no doubt that operating leases create real liabilities,” writes Hans Hoogervorst, Chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in his article Shining the Light on Leases. 
Companies can have deceptively lean balance sheets despite having significant long-term operating lease commitments and in many cases, accounting does not reflect the real economic situation of the company.
Unwitting investor
While many investors seek to compensate for this by estimating the value of operating leases as if they were on the balance sheet, these calculations are usually inaccurate. Hoogervorst writes: “Moreover, not all investors are able to do this “add-back” and the prevalence of operating leases indicates that companies are aware of that. In some cases companies go to great pains to structure their lease obligations so that they remain off-balance sheet, probably to look better in the eyes of the unwitting investor.”
IFRS 16 to reflect economic reality
He adds that the current system under IAS 17 means that companies with similar financial obligations may look very different from an accounting point of view.
IFRS 16 seeks to address these problems and requires all leases to be recognised as assets and liabilities. This will better reflect the underlying economics.
The IASB believes this change will affect roughly half of all listed companies. Hoogervorst writes: “Accounting changes are often controversial and can be met with warnings of adverse economic effects, defaults on debt covenants, and costs of system changes. The IASB has looked at all these possible risks very carefully and has concluded that the risks and costs are manageable"

The IASB has looked at all these possible risks very carefully and has concluded that the risks and costs are manageable.”
IFRS 16 benefits greatly outweigh costs
IFRS 16 will not change the nature of leases – just their accountancy requirements. That means that leases will still be an attractive and flexible source of finance for companies that don't want to bear the risk of owning equipment/premises/fleets, etc.
While there will be a cost in the implementation of IFRS 16, companies aren't required to put leases worth less than $5,000 or with a duration of less than 12 months on the balance sheet, which will protect smaller companies from some of the expense.
Hoogervorst concludes: “We expect the benefits of IFRS 16 to greatly outweigh its costs. The new visibility of all leases will lead to better informed investment decisions by investors, and to more balanced lease-versus-buy decisions by management. IFRS 16 will lead to improved capital allocation, which should be beneficial for economic growth.”"

The in-store sales are notoriously crowded, sometimes unsafe, and people often get swept up in the hype and buy things they don't need.
Damaging discounts
But Black Friday and Cyber Monday are also highly questionable from the retailer's point of view. Research by KPMG shows that the top 10 retailers in the UK have had declining annual profit margins since around 2013, which is the year when the US sales event took off in the UK. The consultancy's analysis of the UK's top 10 retailers (by revenue) looked at their annual reports, as well as their annual sales revenue and profit margin data. It said: “The aggregate of these data points highlighted a notable stagnation of cumulative sales revenue and an overall trend of declining profit margins since 2013.”
KPMG warns that there is a downside to heavy discounting: if companies chase the top-line sales growth, they are in danger of underestimating the impact prolonged discounting is having on their bottom line. The firm's Paul Martin said: “We’ve already established that Black Friday doesn’t increase sales for retailers over the Christmas trading period, it simply brings retail spending forward. What’s more, it forces retailers to sell their goods at discounted prices earlier and for longer.”
Data key to sale fraud prevention
But damaging the company's long-term profitability isn't the only Black Friday danger for businesses. With most bargain purchases being paid for by credit/debit card or online, retailers also need to sharpen their fraud protection and prevention tools, as outlined in this Paypers article by Adyen's Attila Dogan and Kount's Brad Wiskirchen. Dogan suggests a granular approach to detecting customer fraud in online platforms by linking transactions made using different devices, through networks and using different online personas. He advises businesses to focus on using a similar approach with their different shopping channels so they know which shoppers buy in-store and which are buying online (and which use both channels). He also suggests that businesses should be ready to adjust their risk settings, as customer shopping habits may change during busy sales/holiday periods"

He also suggests that businesses should be ready to adjust their risk settings, as customer shopping habits may change during busy sales/holiday periods. Wiskirchen sums up the importance of real-time data analysis for retailers: “Granular data, relating to each aspect of a transaction, reveals a host of information and analytics within milliseconds, providing merchants with everything necessary to accept or decline the purchase.”





CTMfile take: This suggests that Black Friday/Cyber Monday isn't just a bad deal for consumers but also for the retailers and businesses that take a cut to their profit margins in order to compete and attract market share. This leaves the question, who does benefit from the post-Thanksgiving shopping frenzy?"

The EMIR framework aims to improve the functioning of OTC derivatives markets in the European Union (EU), by reducing risks via the use of central clearing and risk mitigation techniques, increasing transparency via trade repositories, and ensuring sound and resilient central counter-parties (CCPs).
Steven Maijoor, ESMA Chair, said presenting their report:
""The publication of ESMA's standards on EMIR sees the EU taking its final steps towards meeting the G20 commitment on bringing OTC derivatives trading under supervision, and provides clarity to the market on the shape of the new regime. The new regulatory framework reduces the risks arising from OTC derivatives trading by improving transparency in the sector and ensuring resilient central counterparties.“
""The implementation of this regime enables the EU to play its role in strengthening the global financial system through promoting stable and well-functioning financial markets, ensuring a level playing field for market participants and enhancing investor protection.""
New EU regulatory framework
ESMA's standards on EMIR set out in detail the new regulatory framework for derivatives in the EU.
One objective of this framework was to provide ""Increased transparency and supervision will be achieved by defining the details of derivatives transactions that need to be reported to trade repositories, including the information to be provided to ESMA for the authorisation and supervision of trade repositories and the data to be made available to relevant authorities and the public.""

greater use of purchased options (e.g. caps, swap swaptions)

there will be several Trade Repositorys for derivatives including ClearStream.

However, a lot is still very unclear.

If the session at Eurofinance's Conference last week is anything to go by, many people in corporate treasury including bankers don't really understand the implications of these new standards (or even that they will impact them) and that they will implemented by July 2013!!

It erodes the experiences of your customers, employees, and internal business partners. Companies focused on keeping it simple reap financial rewards and meet customers' expectations.” All three items in the newsletter are important.
Simplicity as a meta-trend
Simplicity guided Steve Jobs in building one of the world’s best companies. But an ethos of effortlessness is not necessarily easy to achieve. Jobs said it best, “Simple can be harder than complex; you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.”
The item goes on to ask, “Is simplicity worth the effort?” And answers, YES giving important details why:

Simplicity makes customers stay
Effort makes customers leave.

Simplicity - a defining quality of the customer experience
Using Intel’s infographic on the Internet of things (apparently there are going to be 200 billion by 2020), WF pick out four key trends again showing the importance of simplicity.
Using faster payments to provide simplicity
Their webinar on how Allstate Insurance used their new fast mobile e-payment and QuickCard Pay solution to simplify the customer experience and the claims payment process for adjustors. Allstate’s #1 concern that drove the project was how: will this change customer experience? will this help our customer satisfaction? Will it get money to people faster?
Another important finding was that simplicity requires conscious collaboration. And that simplicity is the key to adoption by adjusters and customers.    

CTMfile take: These lessons on simplicity and effortless ease of use apply to the corporate treasury department too. Would the services you supply really get an “A” for ease? do they encourage greater use of your services?"

The report provides further evidence, gathered from sources such as dark web and special-access forums, that the powerful AI chatbot, ChatGPT, is being used by threat actors with the intent of carrying out cyberattacks. Though the views differ around the world on how the threat might manifest, BlackBerry’s survey reveals that “ChatGPT's ability to help hackers craft more believable and legitimate sounding phishing emails is the top global concern (53%), along with enabling less experienced hackers to improve their technical knowledge and develop more specialized skills (49%) and its use for spreading misinformation (49%).” The Recorded Future report cautions that “ChatGPT lowers the barrier to entry for threat actors with limited programming abilities or technical skills. It can produce effective results with just an elementary level of understanding in the fundamentals of cybersecurity and computer science”. This may be precisely what draws the next generation of hackers toward ChatGPT. After all, “Using ChatGPT, next-gen hackers will not suffer the same frailties as their predecessors, such as poor coding, misspelled words in phishing emails, and poor target reconnaissance, resulting in more successful hacking incidents”, forewarns Aite-Novarica Group"

The potential for hackers to be guided through AI chatbots on how to explore vulnerabilities in a company’s security widens the threat landscape considerably. The rules of the game in security and fraud prevention are changing, and IT professionals, business leaders, finance chiefs and corporate treasury will have to strengthen cybersecurity defences today to protect their business tomorrow. Shishir Singh, Chief Technology Officer, Cybersecurity at BlackBerry, explains: ""ChatGPT will likely increase its influence in the cyber industry over time. We've all seen a lot of hype and scaremongering, but the pulse of the industry remains fairly pragmatic – and for good reason. There are a lot of benefits to be gained from this kind of advanced technology and we're only beginning to scratch the surface, but we also can't ignore the ramifications. As the maturity of the platform and the hackers' experience of putting it to use progresses, it will get more and more difficult to defend without also using AI in defense to level the playing field."" Indeed, BlackBerry’s research results also revealed that the majority (82%) of IT decision-makers plan to invest in AI-driven cybersecurity in the next two years, and almost half (48%) plan to invest before the end of 2023, preparing to combat new AI-powered cyberthreats with AI-powered defences"

""It's been well documented that people with malicious intent are testing the waters but, over the course of this year, we expect to see hackers get a much better handle on how to use ChatGPT successfully for nefarious purposes; whether as a tool to write better mutable malware or as an enabler to bolster their 'skillset.' Both cyber pros and hackers will continue to look into how they can utilize it best”, states Singh. In this war of algorithms against algorithms at machine speeds, defending an organization successfully with AI is likely to prove more effective in responding to or preventing AI-powered cyberattacks. “Time will tell who's more effective”, Singh concludes"
7897,3410,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/uk-businesses-voice-concerns-over-barriers-to-international-commerce,UK businesses voice concerns over barriers to international commerce,2021-06-10,,"Bottomline has revealed that almost half of businesses across Great Britain (47%) that intend to stop processing outbound international payments are doing so due to the difficulty in tracking them, while 40% plan to stop as they find it difficult to pay international suppliers on time. These issues are acutely felt by small businesses, who are more hesitant than their enterprise counterparts to start making international payments (38% vs 10%).
These findings stem from Bottomline’s sixth annual Business Payments Barometer, which highlights the need to remove barriers and improve the ease and visibility of international payments in order to stimulate the economy and boost business confidence. 
Lack of confidence is felt most by small businesses, seen as crucial to the revival of the UK economy, who rate cash collections as their number one priority in light of ongoing uncertainties caused by the pandemic and Brexit.
""To benefit trade and economic growth, more must be done to highlight the opportunity of using modern digital payment tools that can simplify cross-border payments and streamline operations,"" said Paul Fannon, managing director, Global Business Solutions at Bottomline. ""It’s perfectly reasonable that all businesses should pay international invoices, overseas staff or transfer funds, with the same degree of security, ease and control as making a local payment.""
Businesses focus on survival and prioritise keeping 'cash in'
For businesses of all sizes, priorities focus on keeping 'cash in' and centred on survival rather than business transformation and digital acceleration. In light of this, companies are willing to be flexible, as shown by the fact that two-thirds (64%) are prepared to re-negotiate payment terms in order to maximise their cash flow. This figure drops to 52% for smaller businesses who are less likely to have sufficient reserves to make these changes.
Indeed, 68% of organisations say that receiving money quickly has never been more critical. Almost half of businesses (48%) surveyed had to accept new payment methods in 2020, with 30% claiming to have started receiving mobile payments during the pandemic as a way to remove the friction associated with cash collection.
Conversely, just under half of organisations (48%) claim their cash flow forecasts are rarely accurate, a figure which rises to 56% of enterprise organisations. Decision-makers tend to use more than one method to manage cash flow, with 37% of small businesses still using manual calculations on Excel"
7898,3410,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/uk-businesses-voice-concerns-over-barriers-to-international-commerce,UK businesses voice concerns over barriers to international commerce,2021-06-10,,"Conversely, just under half of organisations (48%) claim their cash flow forecasts are rarely accurate, a figure which rises to 56% of enterprise organisations. Decision-makers tend to use more than one method to manage cash flow, with 37% of small businesses still using manual calculations on Excel.
""Undoubtedly, the pandemic disruption, as well as trade uncertainty related to Brexit, means that forecasting is more difficult than ever,"" said Fannon. ""But this uncertainty suggests a clear opportunity for solutions that can easily address cash management requirements, and organisations should look to new industry initiatives, such as Request to Pay, Confirmation of Payee and Enhanced Data tools to facilitate the billing process. We as an industry need to drive greater awareness around the benefits of existing payment and cash management solutions, empowering smaller businesses in particular with the tools they need to increase financial efficiency, minimise fraud risk and ultimately enhance financial performance long into the future.""
SMEs in the dark on payments regulations, as lack of preparedness increases across the board
Despite clear benefits to help improve cash management, awareness of new payment initiatives and regulations remains low. Worryingly, there has been a consistent decline year on year in preparedness for payment regulations, with businesses at both ends of the spectrum losing confidence in Open Banking. Smaller organisations appear to be most in the dark, with only 38% of decision-makers prepared to embrace Open Banking, compared to 66% of enterprise decision-makers (down from 47% and 70% respectively in 2020).
Similarly, only 32% of small businesses have adopted real-time payments (RTP), versus 61% of enterprise organisations. Real-time payments bring heightened visibility and efficiency to the payments landscape and are incredibly impactful for small businesses looking to improve their cash flow and have their debts settled more quickly; yet one-third (30%) state that they have not adopted and do not plan to adopt real-time payments moving forward, an increase of 14% from 2020.
When asked to rank their top five drivers for change regarding payment processes, small businesses ranked regulatory changes to UK payments in eighth place versus enterprise organisations who placed it in fourth. It is clear that third-party payment partners, such as banks, consulting partners and financial advisers, must do more to explain how each new regulation can directly solve business problems, rather than focusing on industry jargon and red tape"

Fraud felt most by larger organisations
While fraud impacts businesses regardless of size, it appears that worries around fraud are more acute amongst larger companies. Enterprise organisations are significantly more likely than smaller companies to show concern around insider collusion (58% vs 31%), external cyber fraud (69% vs 49%), and authorised push payment fraud (65% vs 41%).
This disparity in concern may, in part, be due to changes in operating circumstances, with many large and enterprise organisations moving towards online and remote methods of working. Accordingly, around half of organisations suggested that they have seen an increase in insider fraud and collusion (48%), overwhelmingly driven by bigger businesses (57% & 53% for large and enterprise respectively), while only 34% of small companies suggest they have seen an increase. In fact, in 2021 alone, enterprise businesses have seen their losses increase by 20% in just one year.
""As we move towards hybrid models of working, developing a multi-layered security strategy will be critical for organisations of all sizes to ensure that insider fraud and collusion does not expand further,"" concluded Fannon.
Methodology
The research was conducted in partnership with Ipsos Mori and commissioned by Bottomline. It consisted of an online survey among 800 financial decision-makers in Great Britain. Financial decision-makers are defined as those who input solely, or as part of a group, into the purchase of accounting, tax or financial services.
The sample of 800 interviews was split into 200 financial decision-makers each from small (10-249 employees or annual turnover of less than £1,999,999), medium (250-999 employees or annual turnover between £2,000,000 and £124,999,999), large (1,000-9,999 employees or annual turnover between £125,000,000 and £499,999,999) and enterprise organisations (10,000+ employees or annual turnover £500,000,000)"

The company says that the new capabilities are breaking new ground in cyber security and fraud prevention. The payment security services and capabilities help protect the integrity of the payments ecosystem by detecting and disrupting fraud threats targeting financial institutions and merchants. The capabilities are available to Visa clients at no additional cost or sign-up, but through Visa’s continued investments in intelligence and technology. 
""Cybercriminals attempt to bypass traditional defences by stealing credentials, harvesting data, obtaining privileged access, and attacking trusted third-party supply chains,” said RL Prasad, senior vice president, Payment System Risk, Visa. “Visa’s new payment security capabilities combine payment and cyber intelligence, insights and learnings from breach investigations, and law enforcement engagement to help financial institutions and merchants solve the most critical security challenges.”
According to a global report by Forrester Consulting commissioned by Visa, ATM cashout attacks that exploit vulnerabilities among financial institutions and processors to remove fraud controls to withdraw money from cash machines fraudulently, and automated testing of values and credentials to gain unauthorised access to information and functionality called “enumeration attacks” were among the most prevalent account-related fraud types identified by respondents. At the same time, card-not-present fraud that includes ecommerce, phone and mail orders was found to be less frequent but caused more damage to businesses—representing nearly 40% of fraud losses and operational costs. Managing payment fraud holistically is imperative to meet these challenges.
Protecting the payments ecosystem  
As threats evolve, Visa says that its payment security capabilities help to holistically protect the core components of the ecosystem - people, data and infrastructure - to maintain trust and connect the world through a reliable and secure digital payment network. The security capabilities add to existing protections and include:

Visa Vital Signs - Actively monitors transactions and alerts financial institutions of potential fraudulent activity at ATMs and merchants that may indicate an ATM cashout attack. To limit financial losses for financial institutions, Visa can automatically or in coordination with clients, step in to suspend malicious activity.
Visa Account Attack Intelligence - Applies deep learning to Visa's vast number of processed card-not-present transactions to identify financial institutions and merchants that hackers may be using to guess account numbers, expiration dates and security codes through automated testing"

Visa Account Attack Intelligence - Applies deep learning to Visa's vast number of processed card-not-present transactions to identify financial institutions and merchants that hackers may be using to guess account numbers, expiration dates and security codes through automated testing. The machine learning technology detects sophisticated enumeration patterns, eliminates false positives, and alerts affected financial institutions and merchants before fraudulent transactions begin.
Visa Payment Threats Lab - Creates an environment to test a client’s processing, business logic and configuration settings to identify errors leading to potential vulnerabilities. For example, Visa can verify if a financial institution is effectively validating cryptograms - dynamically generated codes unique to each transaction - for EMV chip transactions.
Visa eCommerce Threat Disruption - A proprietary solution that uses sophisticated technology and investigative techniques to proactively scan the front-end of eCommerce websites for payment data skimming malware. Identifying potential website compromises limits the amount of time malware might be present on a merchant website and significantly reduces exposure of customer and payment data.

These capabilities are designed to complement Visa Payment Threat Intelligence, which provides actionable and informational cyber intelligence to clients and merchants worldwide. It offers timely intelligence reporting, technical delivery and educational materials. This includes alerts, analysis, technical indicators, and mitigations for potential cybercrime threats, account compromises and fraud"

Export-Import Bank of Korea (Kexim) was the pioneer, issuing South Korea’s first ‘green’ or climate-friendly bond in February 2013, which was for US$500 million with a five-year tenor. It was heavily oversubscribed, with much of the demand from US and European investors.
This month has seen several issuers from the country active in funding environmental, social and governance (ESG) projects. The Republic of Korea went first, issuing its first green and sustainability bonds that raised US$500 million from investors.
The move was quickly followed by several more deals including the issuance of Korea Electric Power Corporation’s (KEPCO) US$500 million green bond, with proceeds aimed at renewable energy and clean transport. The offering was similar in structure to Korea Water Resources Corporation’s US$300 million green/water bond issue in 2018, which also focused on renewable power.
Government initiative
The drive for less carbon-intensive sources of energy is a major policy initiative from South Korea’s government. The country is one of the world’s top 10 carbon emitters and four years ago announced plans to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 37% by the year 2030, against an earlier target of 15-30%. Last July, it said that national emissions would peak in 2020 and then steadily decline over the next decade.
Korea Housing Finance Corporation (KHFC) is also following the sustainability trend, issuing its second social covered bonds this month following a successful debut last October. Demand for the bond, aimed at promoting housing welfare, saw significant demand with the order book peaking at €1.5 billion (US$1.7 billion), and eventually obtaining €500 million from investors including social responsible investing (SRI).
Financial institutions have joined the ESG activity with issuers such as Kookmin Bank and Shinhan Financial Group looking to raise their own respective sustainability bonds with proceeds aimed towards green and social projects in the near future.

However, there is a need to rationalise the use of alternative performance measures (APMs) to avoid the use of non-GAAP performance reporting to ignore inconvenient charges.
Gary R Kabureck argues that, in the current accounting environment, there is a lack of guidance from both IFRS Standards and US GAAP on defining and reporting operating results such as recurring income, earnings from core business operations, EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) and operating profit. He writes: “Unfortunately, today’s APMs are anything but uniformly applied. The challenge for us is to put some order and structure into the reporting of financial performance while simultaneously providing relevant information that faithfully represents the performance of the company.”
Kabureck's article addresses the challenges of providing guidance and definitions for these alternative metrics and looks at what the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) is doing to address this. Click here for the full article.

7905,3414,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/35000-cfos-targeted-this-is-how-london-blue-works,"35,000 CFOs targeted: this is how London Blue works",2018-12-05,,"A group of cyber criminals called London Blue is in possession of a list of about 35,000 chief financial officers (CFOs), which it uses to target financial professionals with business email compromise, or BEC, scams. The existence of the list was uncovered by cybersecurity firm Agari and contained the data of 50,000 financial professionals including CFOs and accountants working at some of the world's largest companies, particularly banks and mortgage firms.
London Blue's modus operandi
Agari's report on London Blue, which was published yesterday, uses the chilling tagline “UK-Based Multinational Gang Runs BEC Scams like a Modern Corporation”. It looks at the working methods of a Nigerian criminal cyber gang, with operatives in the UK and US, conducting BEC scams against companies around the world. Some of the characteristics of the group's modus operandi include:

The criminal group is highly structured and includes members dedicated to typical business functions found in large organisations, including: business intelligence (lead generation), sales management (assignment of leads), email marketing (semi-customized BEC attack emails), sales (the con itself, conducted with individual attention to the victim), financial operations (receiving, moving and extracting the funds), and human resources (recruiting and managing money mules).
It uses commercial data brokers to assemble lists of target victims around the world, enabling it to conduct an email spam campaign “but with the target- specific customization of spear-phishing attacks”.
The hackers get personal, professional and contact data from a variety of open sources such as LinkedIn but they also use proprietary marketing services to obtain lists of legitimate business email addresses.
Companies targeted include small businesses to the largest multinationals, including banks and mortgage companies.
They often target recipients able to authorise high-value money transfers and engineer the compromised email so that it appears to be from one of the company's primary bosses, such as CEO or chairman.
The attack emails typically contain no malware, making them invisible to many of the most common email security measures.
Of the 50,000 corporate executives on the list, 71 per cent were CFOs, 2 per cent were executive assistants, and the remainder were other finance leaders"

Of the 50,000 corporate executives on the list, 71 per cent were CFOs, 2 per cent were executive assistants, and the remainder were other finance leaders.
Targets from 82 different countries were listed but more than half were based in the US and the other most commonly targeted countries were the UK, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands and Mexico.

Agari's report also notes that, according to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), BEC is a $12 billion business. It is also the most popular and most effective email scam, producing four victims for every 100 initial email responses and has an average payment request of $35,000.
'Pure social engineering'
Agari's senior director of threat research, Crane Hassold, told the Financial Times that these BEC scams are based on “pure social engineering” and do not require sophisticated technology. However, the number of attacks reported are rising because they have been proven to work. The report outlines how Agari's own CFO has also been targeted by London Blue – enabling the firm to engage with the cyber group and gather intelligence about its methods and bank accounts.
CFO of multinational falls for BEC scam
Tim Sadler, co-founder and CEO at Tessian, an email security firm, highlights a recent case in which the CFO of Pathé was duped by a BEC attack and €19 million was stolen. Sadler commented: “As Agari’s research highlights, high profile and c-level employees of financial institutions are becoming increasingly popular targets of BEC scams because they have access to lucrative data and have the power to authorise high-value money transfers. The Pathé incident from a few weeks, in which 19 million euros was stolen after the company’s CFO was duped by a BEC email scam, also emphasises how effective, and costly, these attacks can be"

And Corin Imai, senior security advisor at security risk intelligence firm DomainTools, commented: “These scams prey on the high-pressure environments of large corporations, hoping that those responsible for transferring funds will be more concerned with completing the task quickly than by making sure it is an authentic request. CFOs should make efforts to verify any requests that they find unusual. Taking slightly longer to make a transfer is significantly better than unwittingly helping to facilitate a fraudulent transaction.”"

The measures are part of Commission's ongoing work to reduce risk in the banking sector and build on existing EU banking regulations that have been put in place to address systemic weaknesses in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
Capital Requirements Directive and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive
The proposals amend the following pieces of legislation:

The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) which were adopted in 2013 and which set out prudential requirements for credit institutions (i.e. banks) and investment firms and rules on governance and supervision;
The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR) which were adopted in 2014 and which spell out the rules on the recovery and resolution of failing institutions and establish the Single Resolution Mechanism.

Europe needs strong + diverse banks
Valdis Dombrovskis, the commissioner responsible for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, said: “Europe needs a strong and diverse banking sector to finance the economy. We need bank lending for companies to invest, remain competitive and sell into bigger markets and for households to plan ahead. Today, we have put forward new risk reduction proposals that build on the agreed global standards while taking into account the specificities of the European banking sector.""
The reforms include measures to increase the resilience of EU institutions and enhancing financial stability, measures to improve banks' lending capacity to support the EU economy, as well as measures to further facilitate the role of banks in achieving deeper and more liquid EU capital markets to support the creation of a Capital Markets Union.

During the first quarter of 2020, ransomware threat actors took advantage of the economic and workplace disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Spam attacks related to the outbreak surged and seldom used ‘work-from-home’ network configurations led to increased ransomware attacks across the board. Some threat actor groups continued attacking healthcare organizations, while others refused to target them. The report shows victim demographics and resolution metrics based on actual ransomware cases handled by the Coveware Incident Response team.
In Q1 2020, the average enterprise ransom payment increased to US$111,605, up 33% from Q4 2019. Ransomware distributors increasingly targeted large enterprises and were successful in forcing ransom payments for the safe recovery of data. Large enterprise ransom payments are the minority by volume, but the size of the payments dramatically pulled up the average ransom payment. The median ransom payment remained relatively stable at US$44,021, up only slightly from the Q4 2019 median of US$41,179. The stability of the median reflects the fact that most ransom payments were modest relative to the average.  
 
PNC Paycheck Protection Program loans hit US$14bn
The PNC Financial Services Group has announced that the US Small Business Administration (SBA) has registered more than 70,500 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans totalling US$14bn for PNC small business customers. These small businesses are estimated to employ more than 1 million people.
Of the loans for PNC customers processed and registered with the SBA, 85% were from PNC’s Business Banking segment, which services businesses, including non-profits, sole proprietors and independent contractors, with less than US$5m in annual revenues. Further, approximately 79% of the registered loans were for amounts of US$150,000 or less, with an additional 17% for amounts between US$150,000 and US$1m . The average loan size was less than US$200,000.

EU and Mexico agree trade agreement
The European Union and Mexico have concluded the last outstanding element of the negotiation of their new trade agreement. EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan and Mexican minister of Economy Graciela Márquez Colín agreed on the exact scope of the reciprocal opening of public procurement markets and a high level of predictability and transparency in public procurement processes. With this, the EU and Mexico can advance to the signature and ratification of this agreement in line with their respective rules and procedures.
Under the new EU-Mexico agreement, practically all trade in goods between the EU and Mexico will be duty-free. The agreement also now includes progressive rules on sustainable development, such as a commitment to effectively implementing the Paris Climate Agreement. It is also the first time that the EU agrees with a Latin American country on issues concerning investment protection. Simpler customs procedures will further help boost exports.
The broader Global Agreement, of which the trade agreement is an integral part, also covers the protection of human rights, as well as chapters on political and development cooperation. It will also be the very first EU trade agreement to include provisions to fight corruption, with measures to act against bribery and money laundering. The legal revision of the agreement is now being finalised. Once the process is concluded, the agreement will be translated into all EU languages. Following the translations, the Commission proposal will be transmitted for signature and conclusion to the Council and European Parliament.

Payments and FX firm Finablr has discovered a previously unacknowledged debt pile of US$1.3bn. This is the latest blow to the company, which had its share suspended in March following the discovery of US$100m of undisclosed cheques and the exit of the company’s CEO.
As a result, Finablr hired forensic investigators Houlihan Lokey to act as an Independent Financial Adviser. As part of this role, Houlihan Lokey has worked with Kroll (in its role as independent investigators reporting to the independent directors of the Company) in conducting an exercise with Finablr’s creditors to establish the current indebtedness position of the Finablr Group. The members of the new management team of Finablr have been working closely with Houlihan Lokey and Kroll as part of this exercise based on the information available to them.
The results of this exercise currently indicate that the total net indebtedness of the Finablr Group may be approximately US$1.3bn (excluding any liabilities of the Travelex business). This is materially above the last reported figure for the Group’s indebtedness position as at 30 June 2019 and the levels of indebtedness previously disclosed to the Board. A statement from the company says that the Board cannot exclude the possibility that some of the proceeds of these borrowings may have been used for purposes outside of the Finablr Group.
The exercise to verify the Group’s indebtedness position is ongoing. The Company and Houlihan Lokey intend to engage further with the Group’s creditors to explore the options that may be available to the Group and its creditors, the statement concludes"

Canada’s BMO Financial Group, aka Bank of Montreal, has emerged as the buyer for Bank of the West, the US arm of France’s BNP Paribas, after agreeing a price of US$16.3bn for the acquisition.
The all-cash deal, expected to close in 2022, promises to accelerate BMO’s expansion into the US, where it has been developing a presence in recent years. Combined, the purchase gives BMO around 500 branches and offices and the two banks combined will have around US$870 billion in assets.
The sale enables BNP Paribas to exit US retail banking, where it struggled to compete with larger rivals and focus its expansion plans on Europe, where in the past two years it has taken on equity and prime broking businesses from Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse.

The French bank will use proceeds from the sale to fund more share buybacks and to finance bolt-on acquisitions in Europe. “This is a value accretive transaction for all sides, which emphasises the quality of the Bank of the West franchise,” commented BNP Paribas CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafe. More details on the bank’s strategic plans will be announced early in 2022.
Bank of the West was established in 1874 and was bought by BNP Paribas in 1979, which subsequently merged it with French Bank of California. It was the French bank’s largest business outside of Europe.
Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu, who owns BNP Paribas shares, said that the deal was logical: “Bank of the West was not that strategic for them. They were never going to be a major retail bank in the US, and they can focus more on their European investment banking, where they make more profits.”
BMO said the acquisition will add nearly 1.8 million to its customer base and extend its banking presence in the US through 514 additional branches and commercial and wealth offices in key. growth markets. It will also give the Canadian company around US$56 billion in loans and US$89 billion of deposits.

Vegan firms assessed ahead of Veganuary
Despite supply chain issues in 2021, the global plant-based meat market is still expected to average annual growth of 18.9% over the next five years to reach £13 billion (US$17.2bn) by 2026, reports UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown.
In its assessment of the market ahead of “Veganuary” next month, it considers vegan players such as Microsoft, Apple, Intel and Visa as well as major names in the food and drink sector.
The firm notes that the past year has often been difficult for “some of the headline acts on the vegan billboard” and investors may need to be patient before they realise any significant returns. “Larger more diversified food producers, muscling in on the vegan space have been more resilient, offering greater strength through diversity of product ranges, and with more advanced supply networks and pricing power,” it adds.
Hargreaves Lansdown says that Microsoft is among the technology companies held by its Vegan Climate Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) as none of its activities are perceived to exploit animals. It has also made strides in reducing emissions and aims to be carbon negative by 2030 to limit harm to the planet overall. 
While Apple is not usually associated with animal welfare, it’s also considered to be vegan friendly and is held by the Vegan Climate ETF. It has purchased four gigawatts of renewable energy and is partnering with Conservation International to invest in forests and ecosystems with the aim of removing one million metric tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere.
Semiconductor maker Intel is another stock to consider for its environmental credentials as it has a goal to rely on renewable energy for all its global electricity use.

Maersk signs supply chain management partnership with Unilever
A P Moller-Maersk, the Danish shipping and logistics multinational is partnering with Unilever to develop the consumer product giant’s supply chain management.
The four-year partnership will begin at the start of 2022 and focus on the development and management of Unilever’s International Control Tower Solution – an operational management solution which will consolidate the execution of its global ocean and air transport, while increasing visibility and efficiency and reducing emissions.

Maersk will provide operational management of international ocean and air transport, underpinned by its digital supply chain platform NeoNav.

The NeoNav platform was designed to improve logistics operations, by providing end-to-end transparency, control, and improving decision-making based on data.

“NeoNav offers actionable insights on how to optimise the supply chain, for example in terms of carbon emissions,” said Aymeric Chandavoine, head of logistics and services at A P Moller-Maersk. “Unilever having one of the most effective supply chains in the world, we are glad that we can further support them, enhancing their resilience and transparency through our digital platform and taking it to the next level"

Deutsche Bank’s appetite for Latin America revives
Deutsche Bank intends to invest in Latin America in 2022 – six years after downsizing its presence in the region – and plans to open a new Mexico office as it seeks to maintain the positive momentum of its global emerging markets business, according to a Euromoney report.
In late October 2015, Deutsche Bank announced that it would leave 10 countries and cut 16,000 jobs as part of a reorganisation to cut peripheral businesses and exposures. LatAm bore much of the brunt, as it exited from Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Brazil remained the bank’s only regional office, but was sharply downsized, with local trading desks closed.
Its fortunes have subsequently improved, with both ratings and the share price rising in 2021. Deutsche Bank’s global emerging markets (EM) investment banking businesses – headed by Sameen Farooqui in Singapore – has been one of the bank’s best performers.
Gabriel Roitman, Deutsche Bank's head of client coverage and LatAm head EM origination in New York, said that its growth has so far largely been driven out of Asia and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEEMEA) countries. “We’re going to use the success and strength we have in Asia and CEEMEA to keep investing in LatAm,” he confirmed to Euromoney"

In other news, both Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have announced that their customers will be able to use the giropay method to pay for online shopping. 
Users need their access data (username and PIN) from online banking, and the payment is confirmed by means of a transaction authentication number (TAN). Customers of the two banks can pay in thousands of other online shops such as electronics retailers or airlines by online transfer. According to a paydirekt representative, the integration of giropay at Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank is a step towards a standardised online payment method for German banks.
The online payment methods giropay and paydirekt are being combined under the giropay brand. Paydirekt laid the foundation for the merger with the takeover of giropay in December 2020. A transition phase began in May 2021, during which the two digital payment methods of the German banks and savings banks will be gradually merged"

MiFID delays
Some teething problems were expected when the clock struck midnight and in the event, regulators in Britain and Germany gave some of Europe's biggest futures exchanges (Ice Futures Europe, the London Metal Exchange, Eurex) more time to implement the rules – quite a bit of extra time, 30 months to be precise. This will take the MiFID 'go-live' date for these exchanges to June 2020, long after the date on which the UK is due to leave the EU (considering there may also be a transition period for Brexit).
This follows an earlier reprieve announced by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), allowing institutions an extra six months to comply with MiFID rules on having individual reference numbers for trading (known as Legal Entity Identifiers/LEIs). See this CTMfile article for more details: Is your LEI code ready for MiFID II?
'Brutal' amount of changes
MiFID II requires more detailed reporting of trades, necessitating a significant upgrade for the trading and reporting systems in financial institutions and brokerages, costing large banks upwards of €40 million. Many have criticised the level of detail that MiFID demands and some argue that national regulators won't be able to process and oversee the huge amount of data that will be produced.
One regulation lawyer told the Financial Times: “In truth, keeping up with all of the rule changes, updates and reprieves is absolutely brutal. You need the ability to identify all the changes – which is impossible to master – and then work out how they track through legally, operationally and commercially.”
In short, MiFID II comes at a huge cost to trading institutions. It also unbundles the cost of research, which asset managers previously received gratis (paid for as part of trade commissions). This FT author points out how this could lead to a situation in which smaller customers are unable to get to access to the best research products, giving an advantage to the big players"

However, global economic growth is expected to pick up steam in the second half of the year, ultimately surprising on the upside and pushing the S&P 500 Index to 1600, a new all-time high.
BofA Merrill Lynch analysts outlined 10 macro calls on which they are basing their 2013 outlook:

global economy grows 3.2 percent, gradually improving through the year, led by China and the U.S. Resolution of the fiscal cliff in the U.S. and successful negotiation of aid to Spain, combined with high liquidity and low commodity prices, should support a gradual improvement in global business and consumer spending through the year. By the end of 2013, growth is expected to rise to 2.5 percent in the U.S. and 8 percent in China.
fiscal austerity in the U.S. and Europe offsets monetary stimulus from central banks. Monetary easing may not be enough to offset fiscal contraction in the first part of the year. Fiscal austerity in Europe and in the U.S. – the latter by as much as 2 percent of GDP – is likely to be a drag on growth.
U.S. housing recovery builds momentum. U.S. home prices are expected to rise another 3 percent in 2013, adding to the 5 percent gain in 2012. Housing starts could increase by more than 25 percent and a 3.5 percent average annual appreciation over the next 10 years should stimulate jobs to construction and related sectors such as furniture, building materials and financials.
flares, not wildfires in Europe. With support to Spain from the European Central Bank, the European economy should stabilize as the year progresses. Despite a series of episodic flare-ups of the ongoing crisis in Europe, the big tail risk of a Eurozone breakup has likely passed.
China should lead emerging market growth. Against a backdrop of subdued growth in developed markets, GDP growth in emerging markets is expected to recover to 5.2 percent, led by the BRIC economies, particularly China. However, rising inflation could leave emerging market policymakers with little room to ease.
global equities should be the best-performing asset class"

However, rising inflation could leave emerging market policymakers with little room to ease.
global equities should be the best-performing asset class. Powerful policy support, reasonable valuations and receding tail risks should help make global equities the best performing asset class in 2013. The U.S., European and Asian equity markets could see gains of 10 percent to 16 percent next year, with the MSCI AWI reaching 370 and the S&P 500 Index reaching a new all-time high of 1600 by year-end.
interest rates and currencies: The U.S. dollar and Euro could rally on the global recovery and greater fiscal clarity, pushing the yen lower and emerging market currencies higher.
high yield and emerging market bonds should outperform corporate credit. On the heels of record-low yields in 2012, U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds are likely to offer scant returns of 1.6 percent in the year ahead, but high yield bonds could return up to 7.0 percent and emerging market bonds could return 10.1 percent.
Fixed Income: Government bond yields should rise modestly. G3 central banks are expected to maintain their zero-interest rate policies. Government bond yields in the U.S., U.K. and Germany are expected to rise modestly to 2.0, 2.5 and 1.5 percent, respectively, translating into total returns for major government bond markets of roughly -3 percent to +2 percent.
Commodities: Gold could rise to $2,000 per ounce. Large-scale policy easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank positions gold as a useful hedge against global macro and inflation risks"

The latest example is BofA Merrill’s partnership with HighRadius to provide a new ‘Intelligent Receivables’ platform that that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and other software to help companies vastly improve their straight-through reconciliation (STR) of incoming payments to help them post their receivables faster.
Overcoming core problems
Matching incoming payments with invoices has long been a frustration for companies. Many valuable hours are spent trying to determine who's paying for what. Intelligent Receivables is designed for large or complex companies that are seeking to reduce costs, decrease days-sales-outstanding (DSO), and improve cash forecasting and their end-customer experience. The new solution is designed for companies that manage a large volume of payments where the remittance information is either missing or received separately from the payment.
Incomplete remittance information typically leads to an arduous and costly reconciliation process, explained Rodney Gardner, head of Global Receivables in Global Transaction Services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""Our solution brings together AI, machine learning and optical character recognition (OCR), setting a new bar in accounts receivable reconciliation and payment matching,"" 
Intelligent Receivables, which is powered by HighRadius, a fintech enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) company, achieves improved straight-through reconciliation through four steps:

Identifies payers and associates their payments to remittances that are received separately.
Extracts remittance data from emails, email attachments, electronic data interchange (EDI) and payer web portals.
Matches payments to open receivables using the enriched remittance data.
Creates a receivables posting file that the client uploads to their ERP system.

The platform provides additional functionality to help companies improve STR, for example:

The solution’s dashboard reporting can assist in cash forecasting and help clients better understand payer behavior.

Platform benefits
The platform brings together Data Aggregation, Data Correction and AR Matching processes supported by HighRadius’s  ‘clever AI functions’ to:

improve document and payment matching, so freeing up A/R staff for other tasks
Reduce DSO rates
Reduce write offs and return of funds that could not be identified
Improve customer relations in many ways, e.g. minimising the calls to customers saying “You haven’t paid” when actually they had, it was just part of another payment.

The overall impact of Intelligent Receivables plaform is to reduce manual intervention in the A/R process through better matching and data capture. Importantly it can be integrated with other cash management processes, as Maria Mandler, managing director in Global Receivables, Global Transaction Services, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, points out, “Intelligent Receivables is an innovative financial tool, which not only enhances Straight Through Reconciliation of receivables, but, when paired with Virtual Accounts and Foreign Exchange rate protection, it can solve additional Receivables challenges.  These include enhancing Receivables on behalf of structures, and enabling local currency invoicing.” 
Global rollout
Intelligent Receivables is currently available in the United States and Canada. It will become available in other countries and regions later this year.

CTMfile take: In A/R, it is all coming together: Intelligent Receivables is a fine example of how banks are integrating specialist services from fintechs with their basic services (nothing is more basic than A/R), and then further integrating this solution with other services"

There are several mandatory amendments mostly relating to the UETR (Unique End-to-end Transaction Reference). In this SWIFT release all users of Category 1 and 2 messages will be impacted, regardless of whether or not they use the SWIFT gpi service.
Global fintech provider Volante Technologies confirmed that it has incorporated the necessary changes to the messages as well as provided full support for SWIFT gpi, including the supplementary message format validation rules in SWIFT 2019, which covers the syntax and semantic validations to be performed for various MT messages impacted by these changes.
Volante’s SWIFT standards update also includes support for flexible access to SWIFT gpi data in SWIFTRef repositories.
Christine Barry, research director at Aite Group, commented, “As financial message standards evolve it is important that systems within financial institutions quickly understand the changes and take advantage of what they may offer in terms of potential increased processing efficiency and the business advantages they may bring.”
Venkat Malla, VP Product Management, Volante Technologies, added, “. This update is important not just for our clients, but for the industry as a whole, as we continue to support the revolution in the payments industry as it moves increasingly towards a more real-time environment.”
R3 partnership
At the end of last month Swift’s CEO, Gottfried Liebbrandt, announced that the institution would be partnering with blockchain start-up R3, despite past keen rivalry between the two.
Established in 2014, R3 leads a consortium of major financial institutions and aims to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the banking industry.
Under the new partnership, Swift will link its GPI technology to R3’s  blockchain platform Corda. Firms using R3’s Corda network will be able to authorise and settle payments with the help of a gateway called GPI Link, Swift said"

By 1996, Diel knew that his heart really lay in being part of the corporate treasury function rather than a banking career, so he took the plunge and moved to KUKA, the robotics producer, where he stayed for eight years. “I was working directly with the CFO and it was a great experience starting the treasury function from the beginning where you could design it properly and build connections to accounting and to the planning team.” As it happened, they implemented SAP as their enterprise resource planning (ERP) scheme at the time, with treasury being the very first module. “Sometimes people ask me if 20 years or so in treasury is boring, and I always say the same thing – it is not, because treasury isn’t just treasury, it provides answers to accounting, tax, planning and investor relations questions every day, so I am always using the business administration I covered in my studies, and I can apply it on a very wide basis.” Diel believes it is this breadth of application that explains why people stay in treasury for a long time.

7927,3423,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/heart-of-the-enterprise,Heart of the enterprise,September 2019,Digesting growth,"Nobody, says Diel, should notch up years with an organisation without checking their learning curve. And doing that can sometimes mean that it is time to move on. In 2006, he joined SAP as Head of Treasury Finance. He was responsible for group liquidity planning, financial risk management, subsidiary financing and the corporate finance remit such as external funding (e.g. mergers and acquisitions finance). Leading a team of four people, he joined just at the time when SAP was looking to the debt capital markets to fund its next phase of growth through acquisition. Up until then, he explains, “SAP never had any financial debt, not a single euro”. First on the list was Business Objects, which SAP bought for €4.2bn, announcing its inclusion into the company on 22 January 2008. This marked a growing trend of consolidation in the business software industry – Oracle had acquired Hyperion in 2007 and IBM took over Cognos in 2008. A string of other acquisitions followed, including cloud-based business commerce company Ariba (US$4.3bn, May 2012) and expenses toolkit Concur (US$8.3bn, September 2018). “To take the mergers and acquisitions (M&A) path, we had to develop certain capabilities and expertise from scratch, constantly improving our effectiveness and transforming the financing structure,” reflects Diel. Up until that point, the treasury function was almost entirely focused in Germany, but as the company grew and developed into a global organisation regional treasury teams were set up. “Now we have a team of nine people from all around the world, from São Paulo to Shanghai and Beijing,” comments Diel. SAP regularly publishes its Days Sales Outstanding and cash conversion ratio, which are, says Diel, “the most important metrics”. Inventory management isn’t really an issue, but overdue receivables involve senior management and SAP has customer councils that are focused on reducing these"

An updated extract of this was published by TMI in 2013.1 A proper understanding of a company’s capital structure is an important part of the treasurer’s curriculum, he says, because of “recurring strategic funding discussions with senior management”; and the increased importance of intangible businesses (knowledge-based industries) in the global economy during the past two decades compared with the role of traditional, tangible business models. For a software company such as SAP in a constantly changing technology market environment it is important, says Diel, “to have the ability to seize opportunities as they arise”. This might be M&A opportunities, but also organic growth investment. “To ensure permanent access to debt financing it is important to have a strong credit rating,” Diel declares. “Since 2010 we have invested more than US$40bn in acquisitions [see Figure 1]. And while SAP is a very dynamic and growth-operating business, it has a somewhat conservative financial profile – which is what appeals to both debt and equity investors. The combination plays out very well.”"

But just a couple of weeks before the ratings committees met to finally decide on the rating, SAP made one of its biggest acquisitions ever [Concur], making our discussions with the ratings agencies void again.” This is, apparently, a day in the life of treasury, and Diel was pleased that even with the additional debt volume of €7bn, the single A rating was preserved. Track record is imperative to ratings agencies, and SAP’s history of repaying debt quickly when it did not have a rating, combined with its very high cash flow, helped build the trust"
7931,3423,flow.db.com,https://flow.db.com/cash-management/heart-of-the-enterprise,Heart of the enterprise,September 2019,Inside the digital boardroom,"“Competitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering and supporting its product,” declared the esteemed Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter.3 Porter went on to classify the value chain into “primary activities” and “secondary/support activities”. Firm infrastructure, including finance, is in the “support” category, but actually holds the whole enterprise together. What SAP has done is develop a means by which organisations can bring both activities together into one dashboard. SAP maintains that some “77% of the world’s transaction revenues touch an SAP system” and that it helps “companies of all sizes and in all industries run at their best”.4 At the heart of all this is the ERP system. The architecture has changed over the years – client/server having made way for cloud – but the principle has not. By positioning itself as the ‘must-have’ business application and analytics software, with a consistent innovation programme, the company has not only become the leading global business software provider in the world, but accepts the responsibility this brings when its tools are inside a customer’s enterprise. “We must help leaders in all sectors find the proper balance between human judgement and machine speed”, noted CEO Bill McDermott in the 2018 annual report to investors.5 Corporate treasury is a vital component of the support activities and Diel noted there was a huge opportunity to build proper functionality with instant reporting as part of the overall offering, although of course the ERP architecture does not prevent third-party providers connecting through an interface. Diel and his treasury team became the perfect pilot customers. “We see in the treasury community what requirements treasurers have,” he explains. The flagship offering is SAP Treasury and Risk Management, which integrates with cloud-based SAP S/4HANA, the ERP for large enterprises that superseded the SAP R/3 (there is also an SME version). “Its development was heavily driven by my team,” says Diel. Gone are the days of endless customisations that got in the way of developing robust reporting solutions. Now, treasurers can set up dashboard solutions in the SAP Analytics Cloud designed especially for corporate treasury customers"

Gone are the days of endless customisations that got in the way of developing robust reporting solutions. Now, treasurers can set up dashboard solutions in the SAP Analytics Cloud designed especially for corporate treasury customers.6 This is, in turn, integrated into the overall digital boardroom that has feeds from the ERP, customer relationship management and human resources systems to provide, as the website puts it, “one source of truth across all business areas”.7 Without the need to connect to third-party technology via application programming interfaces (Diel is justifiably proud of the one-stop-shop approach), the dashboard provides a real-time view of major treasury risk and finance key performance indicators such as: Liquidity and investments; Financial risk; Indebtedness; and Trapped cash. It also features market overview and scenario modelling tools. “We are working on a cash flow planning tool which is based on the enterprise’s profit and loss and the value driver tree, so you can get the benefit of multi-year planning,” says Diel. 77%of the world’s transaction revenues touch an SAP system(SAP) Using fictitious data, he demonstrates how the balance sheet exposures of all SAP subsidiaries around the world can be seen at the touch of a button. “Then you have a report where you can see the accumulated euro exposure of a certain legal entity… and as we drive via thresholds we see exactly which legal entities exceed the threshold,” he adds. When asked for a sample scenario, Diel explains: “If you are a treasurer and have the euro exposure of South Korea, for example, you don’t know what is behind the exposure. It could be a receivable against the US dollar. Or it might be a receivable against the Japanese yen. With this balance sheet exposure application you can drill down to the very last posting and see what drives the exposure.” This is why, he says, SAP needs banks with a strong regional footprint. The company can’t be in all the countries that use its products. “A global presence of banks was a clear criterion when we decided on our core bank group,” he explains. “We have had a very strong relationship with Deutsche Bank for a number of years,” Diel adds"

When asked how he sees the next five years of driving the organisation’s treasury management – and helping develop the treasury portfolio – Diel says: “We should take the benefit of the SAP application environment like we did with the digital boardroom and dashboard, but also work on other use cases for new technologies.” Right now the team is working on a fraud prevention project via a distributed ledger solution and an ‘intelligent’ (automated) hedging solution. Our visit to the vast Walldorf headquarters near Mannheim brought back memories of another visit two decades earlier to the US Microsoft ‘campus’ in Redmond, Washington, where everyone seemed very at home in their work environment. Creativity and trying new things are also embedded in this company’s culture, along with its passion for continuous learning – and its people. Data scientists and technology experts need to be in an environment they can feel comfortable in – and the same applies to the finance team, which has designated roles such as stewards, business partners and transformation agents. Diel is justifiably proud of SAP’s approach to diversity, which goes beyond well-written CSR reporting. As Executive Sponsor for SAP’s diversity and inclusion implementation for the board area, he reinforces the message that differently abled people (rather than ‘disabled’) bring unique innovation dimensions just as powerfully as cross-generational inclusion taps into different experience sets.8 Diel says this responsibility brings him “a lot of joy”. “Above all, be curious,” he concludes. “And leave your comfort zone.” It’s clear that Deutsche Bank’s loss of a talented graduate trainee in 1996 has been SAP’s gain, and Diel is a key artery within the beating heart of what makes SAP such a special kind of enterprise"

7936,3424,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/five-unintended-consequences-of-gdpr,Five unintended consequences of GDPR,2018-04-10,,"GDPR will make the collection and use of data more expensive for companies and could mean the end of free search engines and music websites, meaning that, in the end, the consumer will pay. In the wake of revelations about how our personal data has been used by Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and other companies, it seems that the introduction of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can't come a day too soon. The regulation clarifies the issue of who owns personal data (the individual) and who is responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of personal data of EU-based customers/clients/contacts (the organisation). So far, so good, but will GDPR also herald “the end of the free Internet”, as some have suggested? What might be the unintended consequences of the EU regulation that seeks to protect consumer privacy and clamp down on lax online data security? In his article, GDPR and the End of the Internet’s Grand Bargain, in Harvard Business Review, Larry Downes looks at how GDPR could affect both companies and consumers.
1. Boost for EU data storage firms
Downes points out that, while perfectly legal, it's more complex to comply with GDPR if your company stores data outside the EU. He writes: “While European data may still be legally stored outside of the EU, for example, it’s much easier to comply with GDPR if data remains within the borders — a boon to a fledgling European cloud services industry.”
2. Huge costs
Buying the technology to comply with GDPR represents a significant, if not huge, cost for large companies. This survey puts the cost in the region of £430,000 for FTSE350 companies, and $1 million for Fortune 500 companies. Companies may also have to appoint highly trained personnel to oversee compliance.
3. Careful what you wish for
Consumers/users/clients will have control of their personal data and will have the “right to erasure”, meaning they can at any time withdraw consent for the personal data to be held and used by large organisations. The unforeseen consequence of this is that individuals will have to deal with far more consent and authentication requests. Downes writes: “users will be barraged with interruptions to the flow of their online lives, forced to review, decide, and reconsider each element of information they enter"
7937,3424,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/five-unintended-consequences-of-gdpr,Five unintended consequences of GDPR,2018-04-10,,"The unforeseen consequence of this is that individuals will have to deal with far more consent and authentication requests. Downes writes: “users will be barraged with interruptions to the flow of their online lives, forced to review, decide, and reconsider each element of information they enter. In economic terms, every new mandatory disclosure, user control, and privacy “dashboard” introduces transaction costs into interactions that previously didn’t have them.”
4. End of the grand bargain
Downes also argues that the current online status quo – the free use of our individual personal data in exchange for personally targeted marketing and advertising placements – is a business model that won't work as well and could even become unsustainable when large tech firms are forced to comply with GDPR. Calling this “the Internet's grand bargain”, Downes says that “the new costs and potential penalties associated with collecting, analysing, and marketing user-provided information have become unsustainable, requiring a new business model altogether”. He concludes with this sobering thought: “The age of the free and open internet may come to an end, and quickly. That may have been the true goal of many calling for “regulation” of tech companies in the first place. If so, the unintended impact on average consumers will be severe and, perhaps for many, decidedly worse than today’s admittedly messy and often leaky online experience.”
5. Good for micropayments?
Another reaction to the “end of the free Internet” could be the proliferation of micro transactions, whereby internet users are charged small amounts to use a search engine, etc. This could benefit companies processing and providing microtransaction services. in many cases the same firms (Amazon, Apple, PayPal. etc) that are the leaders in the online space"

In a statement published at the start of this week on its website, the Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) announced that it had decided to provide primary dealer banks with a liquidity facility within the framework of open market operations.
The monetary authority added that the interest rate on the new facility, which will be used through overnight repo transactions within predetermined limits, will be set at 100 basis points below the central bank’s benchmark - the one-week repo rate – of 24%.
The limits will be determined by taking into account the amount of government domestic debt securities purchased by primary dealer banks through Treasury auctions, according to the CBRT. “This facility will have a limited share within the overall central bank funding,” it said.
Sovereign credit downgrade
Turkey’s sovereign credit rating was downgraded last week by the credit ratings agency (CRA) Moody’s Investors Service. The move that could further erode already shaky confidence in the nation’s assets days before this Sunday’s controversial re-run[GB1]  of Istanbul elections.
Authorities have adopted increasingly interventionist policies in the face of an exodus of foreign capital that’s driving up yields on government bonds and piled pressure on the Turkish lira (TRY). The currency has weakened further on fears that US president Donald Trump may impose economic sanctions on Turkey as punishment for the country’s purchase of S-400 aire defence missiles from Russia.
“This measure was taken because the Treasury thinks foreign investor interest in auctions will be subdued after the latest Moody’s downgrade,” said Onur Ilgen, Istanbul-based treasury manager at MUFG Bank Turkey AS, told the Bloomberg news service.
Regulators last month ordered Turkey’s pension funds to maintain a minimum amount of local stocks and government bonds. Reports suggested that local banks were also asked to bid for more bonds than they needed in their roles as market makers in debt auctions.
Bloomberg quoted Erkin Isik, senior economist at QNB Finansbank, who said that the average cost of central bank funding would go down by 10 basis points for every 10% of liquidity extended through the new facility.
“My understanding is that the impact on monetary policy will be very limited,” Isik said"

According to the report, Financial Technology and the Corporate, the most common services that are entrusted to non-bank providers are treasury functions, cross-border payments and FX, risk and compliance reporting, and cash management.
The East & Partners report on corporate use of fintech and banking is based on interviews with 737 of the Top 800 global corporates, specifically with the individuals responsible for their firms’ business banking relationship(s). It interviewed executives in companies based in Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK and the US. Some of the highlights from the report include the following findings:
Corporates looking outside traditional relationships
71.5 per cent of the world’s largest corporates currently use a non-bank fintech provider for at least one business banking need, although the adoption rates vary widely across products and markets and, according to Sangiita Yoong, an analyst at East & Partners Asia in Singapore, this is in line with the broader market trend where multi-banking is on the rise. Yoong notes: “Corporates are spreading their core relationship banking further, as evidenced by declining wallet share for primary providers in many product areas.”
Areas where corporates turn to non-banks
The report also found that corporates are using a non-bank provider mainly for the following types of product:

treasury functions (27.7 per cent);
cross-border payments and foreign exchange (20.5 per cent);
risk & compliance reporting (19.7 per cent); and
cash management (10.2 percent).

Yoong also commented that “Corporates across the globe are attracted by the efficiency gains offered by these non-bank providers.”
Chinese and German corporates lead the way

Yoong also commented that “Corporates across the globe are attracted by the efficiency gains offered by these non-bank providers.”

Nearly three in ten (29 per cent) Chinese businesses are using a non-bank fintech for their cross-border payments and foreign exchange needs, more than any other business banking product. A similar proportion – 30.8 per cent – of German corporates are following suit. Yoong adds that treasurers and financial controllers in Mainland China are influenced by the positive experience of being exposed to world-leading payment capabilities and ideas in their private lives. The report found that executives in China, Hong Kong and Singapore said that fintech solutions are making it easier to run their businesses but that banks are somewhat lacking in their ability to keep up with innovation.
'Big four' banks strong in Australia
The report also found that the incumbent 'big four' financial institutions in Australia provide 94.6 per cent of the businesses’ cross-border payments and FX needs, leaving little space for any providers outside the mainstream. Yoong comments: “This is unsurprising given the relatively high levels of satisfaction expressed by customers of ANZ and Westpac, for example, in particular for their cross-border payments services.”"
7944,3429,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/top-3-external-forces-driving-corporate-banking-change,Top 3 external forces driving corporate banking change,2020-01-17,,"In its Corporate Banking 2020 Research Outlook, research firm Celent establishes the idea that corporate bankers face a 2020 landscape shaped by the following three powerful external forces:

Remaining competitive in the midst of a technology arms race.
Enabling a business model transformation for corporate treasury clients.
Funding growth by driving productivity.

The outlook, written by Celent’s head of Corporate Banking, Patricia Hines CTP, notes that corporate banking remains an attractive growth segment, with projected revenue growth of 3-4% over the next few years. Cash management and payments continue to offer especially attractive returns for those banks able to remain competitive.
Competitiveness shouldn’t be assumed, however, as the largest global banks engage in a technology arms race in an effort to grab an out-size share of revenue pools. New and improved client-facing propositions will dislodge large revenue pools from corporate banking incumbents that fail to innovate in the face of billions of dollars committed to technology innovation by Tier 1 banks.
Manual processes combined with limited treasury staff continue to be top operational challenges for treasury and financial professionals. The report says that banks are well-positioned to help clients to transform corporate treasury, incrementally digitalising and digitising their operations, enabling step change with new liquidity management tools, and introducing new, game-changing technologies. Some banks have started down the road to Treasury 4.0, but non-bank tech providers are outpacing the banks, putting additional revenue at risk.
The report points out that incumbent banks continue to struggle with inflexible, expensive legacy systems combined with inefficient support processes across product silos. To drive profitability and release the budget needed for growth initiatives, banks are looking for ways to generate efficiency gains while reducing pain points for customers. Client-facing processes such as customer onboarding and loan origination are obvious candidates, along with less obvious candidates such as traditionally siloed payment systems and operations.
These forces imply a set of specific technology priorities that banks should embrace. Celent says that it is going to focus its research efforts on helping bankers (from line of business executives to technologists, strategists to implementers) educate themselves about key technological questions, prioritise their spending, and execute their strategies. The firm points to its new vendor discovery tool, VendorMatch, as playing an increasingly important role in its vendor analysis"

IOSCO steps up efforts to address sustainability and climate change issues
The Board of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has published its report on Sustainable Finance and the Role of Securities Regulators and IOSCO, which seeks to help market participants address issues related to sustainability and climate change. The report highlights three recurring themes that involve multiple and diverse sustainability frameworks and standards, including sustainability-related disclosure, a lack of common definitions of sustainable activities, and greenwashing and other challenges to investor protection.
The report indicates that many issuers and asset managers operating cross border may be subject to different regulatory regimes or participate in multiple regional or international third-party initiatives. This wide variety of regulatory regimes and initiatives, often with inconsistent objectives and requirements, may prevent stakeholders from fully understanding the risks and opportunities that sustainable business activities entail.
EPA offers guidance on digital identification and authentication 
The Emerging Payments Association (EPA) has published guidance on digital identification and authentication to help combat financial crime. Due to the increased threat of criminal activity, including fraud, money laundering and financing terrorism, The EPA’s Guidebook to Digital Identification and Authentication calls for robust identification and authentication processes to be employed in the financial services industry.
Supported by Refinitiv, it details the component parts of identification and authentication processes, as well as the current solutions and technologies to consider when trying to meet regulatory requirements. The FCA, in its letter to CEOs, recognises the need for alternative verification methods to obtain the evidence required to meet Money Laundering Regulations. However, to ensure evidence such as ‘selfies’ and ‘scanned documents’ are genuine requires great care.

They are increasingly being offered by Payment Service Providers. The latest example is eMerchantPay, a global payment service provider with four offices in Europe as well offices world-wide, who now offer merchants a SEPA Direct Debit service in their range of European e-commerce solutions.
SEPA Direct Debit Solution
The SEPA Direct Debit Solution allows merchants to collect euro-denominated payments from accounts in all European Economic Area countries. Like any other direct debit scheme, the SEPA Direct Debit Solution is based on the concept that the merchant requests money from the customer and, with the customer’s approval (mandate), debits the customer’s account. Direct debit requires both the merchant and the customer to hold a bank account within the SEPA region. The bank accounts may be held in euro or any other SEPA currency, but the actual transfer of funds always takes place in euro. 
eMerchantPay’s SEPA Direct Debit Solution covers the following sectors:

digital goods
physical goods
subscription-based services
debt collecting services
gaming
dating.

eMerchantPay services
Since 2002 eMerchantPay has been providing international online, mobile and POS payment processing services to merchants across the globe. eMerchantPay’s fraud prevention services and payment processing solutions operate in more than 150 currencies and many languages catering for businesses of all types and sizes.

Liquid alternatives are investment vehicles that deliver exposure to alternative asset classes with daily liquidity. Common vehicles include closed-end funds, mutual funds and ETFs. They began proliferating in institutional portfolios following the global financial crisis, during which many investors with large allocations to alternative asset classes experienced liquidity issues caused in part by relatively long lockup periods.
“For more than 20 years, institutional investors have been adding alternative asset classes to their portfolios. More recently, institutions have been adopting exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a versatile, jack-of-all-trades portfolio tool,” explained Andrew McCollum, Greenwich Associates managing director and author of 'Liquid Alternative ETFs: The Next Frontier in Institutional Investing'. “The intersection of these trends could ultimately bring about a transformation of alternative investments in institutional portfolios.”
New, novel and growing
Today, liquid alternatives represent about 4% of institutional assets, with average allocations ranging from a high of 6% of total assets among public pension funds to a low of 2% among corporate funds and OCIOs in the US. These allocations represent US$882bn in institutional assets currently invested in liquid alternatives, including US$564bn from public funds.
For most institutional investors, liquid alternative ETFs represent a relatively new and novel vehicle. However, growing numbers of institutions are taking advantage of liquid alternative ETF’s liquidity and relatively low costs in tasks ranging from manager transitions and tactical portfolio adjustments to taking on long-term investment exposures and replacing fund-of-fund investments.
Institutions using liquid alternative ETFs invest an average 3% of total assets to the funds - a significant allocation that brings the current institutional market for liquid alternative ETFs to some US$47bn. However, over the decade that Greenwich Associates has been tracking the use of ETFs in the institutional market, the firm has documented a consistent pattern that has unfolded across institution type, geographic region and asset class: Institutions start with small investments in ETFs, generally for a single, specific tactical task like a manager transition. In short order, they discover that ETFs are not only safe and effective in these tasks, they are also incredibly flexible"

Over time, institutions start adopting ETFs into a list of more and increasingly strategic portfolio functions.
Greenwich Associates expects liquid alternative ETFs to follow a similar trajectory. Almost 20% of institutions not currently investing in them say they will consider using liquid alternative ETFs in the year ahead. Meanwhile, roughly one in 10 current investors plan to increase allocations to liquid alternative ETFs in the next year. Greenwich Associates projects that, over the next 12 months, institutional investment in liquid alt ETFs will climb to approximately US$114bn - roughly 2.5 times current allocations.
“Given institutions’ embrace of ETFs in other asset classes and their ample appetite for alternatives, it’s possible - even likely - that large numbers of these investors will experiment with liquid alt ETFs when given an opportunity and that allocations and total investment will rise steadily for the foreseeable future,” said McCollum"

The relationships that corporate treasury maintains with banks to manage cash operations are some of the most complicated and often confusing in the entire business.  Because of the general misunderstanding of the cash management services bought from banks and the lack of available time in most treasury organizations, many companies perform only a cursory review of the information banks provide on service usage and costs each month.  In some parts of the world, banks are not yet even providing the details of the number of transactions completed or their cost which leaves geographical blind spots in many organizations.  There are literally millions in errors taking place each month that go unnoticed and we simply have to do a better job.  By most estimates these errors range from 5% to 10% of our total bank fee spend and that represents real money in most companies.  So, what is there we can do?
Key abilities
Over the next several weeks, in a series of articles, we are going to explore several key abilities that must be developed within the treasury group to overcome the challenge of managing bank relationships.  These key abilities that we must develop are:

Accessibility – The ability to receive the service usage and cost information in a usable format, from all accounts, at all banks, anywhere in the world
Accountability – The ability to evaluate the service usage and cost information provided by banks and identify errors at any level through the thousands of line items reported
Visibility – The ability to consolidate and standardize balances, rates, service usage, and pricing information across banks, accounts, countries, currencies, business units, etc. in order to gain an understanding of the internals of the cash management operation
Predictability – The ability to predict the future of your cash management operation by detailed analysis of past service usage and cost information

Technology to preserve precious time
In nearly every treasury organization that I visit, there is already an overload of mission critical tasks to accomplish.  No matter how much you may be convinced that the monitoring of treasury service usage and cost is important, you likely don’t have the excess bandwidth to take on yet another operational task.  Any proposition of adding new abilities to your team must address the issue of time or it will not be possible to maintain the consistency that is needed to effectively manage bank relationships, service usage, and cost"
7951,3433,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/required-abilities-to-get-control-of-your-bank-relationships-and-your-cash,Required abilities to get control of your bank relationships and your cash,2017-10-20,,"No matter how much you may be convinced that the monitoring of treasury service usage and cost is important, you likely don’t have the excess bandwidth to take on yet another operational task.  Any proposition of adding new abilities to your team must address the issue of time or it will not be possible to maintain the consistency that is needed to effectively manage bank relationships, service usage, and cost.  The answer to the time problem is undoubtedly technology!  But, what kind of technology?  
Since banks began charging corporates for the services they use, the FinTech industry has worked to provide solutions to treasurers to help them manage those fees.  Many of these solutions have been very robust from a feature and function point of view giving treasury users dozens of new tasks to accomplish while attempting to manage the mountain of data contained on bank fee billing statements.  While some of these solutions have been very successful in the market, most fall short in the key abilities needed to accomplish the tasks.  
Some cover all of the key abilities, but fall well short in recognizing the importance of protecting the time investment of the treasury team.  The shortcomings in current solutions include:

Over-Complicated: Many complicated and detail driven functions that take the user hours and hours to use each month – Result: System falls into disuse due to the need for user training and lack of time.
Afterthought: Very basic functionality that allows the provider to make a claim of managing bank fees, but with no way to standardize the vast data across banks and only a limited handling of the myriad of file types provided by banks around the world – Result: System does not provide enough insight into what is actually happening, fee savings are missed and treasury becomes convinced that they are doing the best they can.
Regional: Too focused on one particular area of the world, or one type of file leaves the system usable only to region specific clients. – Result: Only a partial view of the global banking picture is provided and the system ends up reinforcing the global blinders that so many companies are trying to shed.
Too Narrow: Functions that only focus on one area of the bank relationship problem"

Too Narrow: Functions that only focus on one area of the bank relationship problem.  Whether it is a system that only looks at error detection or only fee reporting, too many systems leave opportunities, and cash, on the table by not evaluating the whole of the bank relationship – Result: Only a partial view of the picture is presented leaving information, and cash, on the table because only one part of the problem gets solved.
Too Technical: Functions that require a great degree of user knowledge or training to accomplish using complicated interfaces to accomplish even basic tasks – Result: One user may learn enough to be somewhat successful, but all of the system’s usefulness is lost when that user leaves.
Not Technical Enough: Many applications have been built by people that have great ideas on a variety of treasury functions, but fail to recognize the importance of solid software infrastructure and controls resulting in an unsecure environment that cannot support Confidentiality, Data Integrity and Availability.  Result: A system acquired to solve a treasury problem leads to new vulnerabilities to the company.

As we continue into this series of articles we will explore what a treasury team needs to focus on as they look to better manage all aspects of the banking relationships, while reducing fees and gaining visibility into their entire global cash management situation.  
In my next article I will look at Visibility which will explore how the detailed gathering, organizing, aggregating and comparing of bank service charges which can help you monitor all aspects of your cash management engine.

The World Economic Forum helpfully reminds us what they are in the article “Four climate tipping points the planet is facing”1. In the spirit of optimism that continued efforts to change behaviour should be highlighted as it actually does connect with revenue and economic growth, Deutsche Bank’s Corporate Bank Focus Research team decided to take a closer look at what stock market returns and actual customer purchasing decisions were adding to the climate change discussion. “We all remember how BP’s share price halved during Deepwater, but what about the smaller pieces of news that came out? Do they have an impact on share prices?” Deutsche Bank Analyst Luke Templeman, explains in his Podzept podcast, “Climate change and corporates” (20 September 2019) how the team set about finding out.

As for consumer behaviour, while companies know customers don’t always put their money where their mouth is when it comes to climate change and the “gap” between customer attitudes and actions towards green purchases has persisted for several decades, there has been, say Templeman and Head of Corporate Bank Research Jim Reid, ”a startling shift over the past 12 months” according to a Eurobarometer survey published in April 20192 .

Companies that experienced positive press on climate change saw share price outperformance of 1.4 percentage points per year over the MSCI World Index4 – outperformance of 26%. And the usual suspects – energy, materials and utilities – were not the sectors most sensitive to overall positive news flow, but rather technology, consumer staples and healthcare. Conversely, companies with negative press saw underperformance. Furthermore, it was not the usual energy, materials, and utilities sectors that were affected the most. However, the data showed that there were four periods of equity market falls where companies that had experienced negative headlines clawed back their losses – aligning with economic shocks such as the Global Financial Crisis, and the current trade wars. As Templeman and Reid put it, “It appears that equity investors are more sensitive to negative corporate environmental news when times are good but less discerning when the wider market is experiencing turbulence.” In the wealth management space, the report’s authors note that the mega-trend of funds flowing to managers with sustainable mandates is clearly fuelling investor awareness of how share prices move with corporate climate change news. “Indeed”, they say, “The mayors of New York and London are not the only investors taking flight from climate-change related stocks. While some do so for reasons of principle, others do so on value grounds.” An example of this is investor belief that increased regulation will make, for example, the economics of miners and explorers less attractive demonstrated by BNP Paribas Asset Management’s announcement it is to divest up to €1bn of coal stocks5"

For decades, customers have intended to purchase more climate-friendly products, but failed to actually do so. But over the past 12 months, the team’s primary research indicates that twice as many customers in the UK have actively purchased more products from companies that address climate change compared with those who have not. A similar (but more polarised) trend exists in the US. While customer boycotts have rarely dented corporate revenues, this is changing. However, urban customers are fickle and are more likely to rebuy the same product within 12 months. Overall, when people are looking to improve their climate footprint, consumer goods are the first on the chopping block. And around half of them are happy paying more for a product or service if they know (or think they know) the company selling it is addressing climate change"

Investors, point out the report’s authors, are seeing the benefits; “the 1.3 percentage point per annum outperformance of stocks that benefit from improved climate news speaks for itself,” they reflect. In conclusion, they remind readers, “Once social movements hit a tipping point, they have proved very difficult to stop. And as government regulation on the issue continues to increase, climate change mitigation will become a normal part of doing business. Customers have spoken, investors have spoken.

Today, however, treasurers and their systems vendors and banks, are taking a longer-term, more strategic approach to digitisation, automation and data.” Evolution and revolution in digital payments? “Although every market and region is at a different level of maturity in the digitisation of payments, digital payment methods and platforms are emerging globally, with an increasing focus on real-time settlement, rich data and an excellent customer experience.

It is the eighth in a series of reports by the committee, intended to periodically monitor the effects and dynamics of the reforms and provide a benchmark for analysis.The September report is based on data as of 31 December 2014, gathered from 221 banks (and their national supervisors), which were divided into two groups: 100 'group 1' banks (internationally active with Tier 1 capital of more than €3 billion) and 121 'group 2' banks (all other banks).The report found that all large internationally active banks meet Basel III risk-based minimum and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) target capital requirements.The report states: all the 'group 1' banks meet the Basel III risk-based capital minimum requirements as well as the CET1 target level of 7.0% (plus the surcharges on global systemically important banks - G-SIBs - as applicable); between 30 June and 31 December 2014, 'group 1' banks reduced their capital shortfalls relative to the higher Tier 1 and total capital target levels; the additional Tier 1 capital shortfall has decreased from €18.6 billion to €6.5 billion and the Tier 2 capital shortfall has decreased from €78.6 billion to €40.6 billion.The report also found that 85% of all the banks in the sample had a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 100% or more and 98% of the banks reported an LCR at or above 60%. The LCR is a 'buffer zone' of bonds that banks are obliged to hold, so they can withstand market shocks for one month without outside help. Basel III's LCR requirements came into effect on 1 January 2015 and the minimum requirement is currently set at 60%.

The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company, established in 2016, enables merchant service providers, processors, banks, and fintechs to cost-effectively move money between bank accounts in real-time. It said that PayFi’s Branch99TM Real-Time Platform will accelerate community banks’ participation in RTPs on the network developed by TCH.
PayFi recently announced that Avidia Bank, a Massachusetts mutual community bank, had become the first community bank to join the RTP network through its Branch99 Real-Time Platform.
The RTP network is the first new core payments infrastructure built in the US in more than 40 years. Launched by TCH in November 2017, it delivers 24/7 clearing and interbank settlement, including real-time movement of money and enriched data between participating financial institutions (FIs).
The RTP network offers a suite of available use cases and an extensive level of data accompanying each RTP transaction. The network currently reaches more than 50% of US accounts for real-time payment receipt and is “on track to reach near ubiquity in 2020”.
A period of disruption
“We are in the middle of an unprecedented disruption in the banking and payments industries,” said PayFi’s head of growth, Peter Gordon. “The recent announcement of Avidia Bank being the first community bank to commit to joining the RTP network through PayFi’s Branch99TM Real-Time Platform furthers our commitment to community and regional banks.
“The ISO 20022 messaging functionality on the RTP network provides banks of all sizes with rich messaging capabilities to enable conversational commerce, allowing banks to continue to build strong relationships with their customers.”
Steve Ledford, senior vice president and RTP product executive at TCH added: “The Clearing House is excited to partner with PayFi and to work with them to bring real-time payments to their clients.
“We are committed to providing real-time payments capabilities on the RTP network to all US depository institutions.

FIS(SunGard) has  been providing a payment factory solution, TRAX, for many years which has been used by some of the largest MNCs in the world. One of the problems they have continually struggled with has been how to illustrate and convince corporates how useful such a solution is. They have started publishing an ewxcellent series of electronic playbooks on Simplifying the global payments journey, each focused on a particular type of client. The FIS Pharma Playbook describes the day in the life of Thomas, the global treasurer of a pharmaceutical company. The details all the processes and actions involved, and how the TRAX solution can help. At the end it focuses on how the TRAX payment factor solution can be integrated with liquidity management processes and controls, see diagram below.

Tieto’s Treasury Corporte Bank solution
Most corporate treasurers, if they were starting from scratch (I know you cannot really, but read on) would use a structure which integrates the payment factory, the in-house bank and cash management processes with the internal financial systems and with banks and FIs, as below:

Ah, but what about the many flavours of cash and treasury risk management that a large MNC will need as well.

But if you are a large/huge MNC with a complexity and transaction volumes way beyond these systems what what do you do?
Until the last 2-3 years, MNCs had to bring together a combination of various systems from a range of different suppliers, but now much simpler and integrated solutions are becoming available.
Tieto’s Treasury Corporate Bank  
Tieto, the leading Nordic software and services company with offices in 20+ countries, have been providing payment and banking system and services for many years, in their new solution they have integrated all this experience and different systems into a a single solution which when combined with a TMS provides a complete solution to a large MNC’s cash and treasury. They call it, the Treasury Corporate Bank:

The TCB is a complete solution for a multinational corporation with many banks and subsidiaries worldwide. TCB is, Tieto claim:

a new generation, cost effective payment & cash management solution meeting current and future business requirements
a parameter-driven off the shelf solution (not a “tool box”) that shortens time-to-market and facilitates automation and highest possible STP
based on existing mission critical bank software for payments and cash management already used by global enterprises and international banks.

Implementation
The aim of the TCB is to optimise the overall efficiency and control in cash and payment processes across the entire organisation. However, to achieve this, sensitivity to and understanding of the requirements of today’s MNC is needed. Tieto have found that TCB implementation requires consideration of policies, the operational set up, the impact of bank harmonisation and the technologies and infrastructure.

CTMfile take: Any cash and treasury management solution is only as effective as the quality of the integration which isn’t, as Tieto have found, just a technological problem. Total, effective integration has many different aspects"

Card schemes get together with frictionless ‘click-to-pay’

American Express, Discover, Mastercard and Visa are rolling out interoperable one-click checkouts at select e-commerce sites across the US, eliminating the laborious and repetitive key-entry of personal account numbers and information when shopping online. 
Based on the new EMV Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) industry standard, the networks have tested the technology in the market with issuers and merchants and are preparing to introduce click to pay at select sites in the United States this month, leading up to wide availability in early 2020.

Payment processors and payment platforms, such as Adyen, Authorize.Net and CyberSource – Visa solutions, FIS, Global Payments, Mastercard Payment Gateway Services and Stripe are now offering click to pay to merchants. The initial focus will be on converting existing Masterpass and Visa Checkout merchants to click to pay.
First merchants
Cinemark, Movember and Rakuten are the first merchants to adopt the common click to pay button on their websites, with BassPro, JoAnn Fabric and Crafts, Papa John’s, Saks Fifth Avenue, SHOP.com and Tickets.com following by the end of 2019.

India – UPI transactions overtake debit card payments
The number of transactions via the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has overtaken the number of debit card transactions in 2018-19, according to a Reserve Bank of India report.


Cash and coins
Bankers and governments are starting to worry about the disappearance of cash and coins. The removal of bank branches and ATMs from Britain's high streets has led to a debate about the consequences for a disenfranchised segment of the populace - estimated to comprise eight million individuals - who would struggle to cope in a cashless society. The UK’s Payment Systems regulator believes that the whole system of access to cash needs to be looked at again because it is so important in so many peoples’ lives.

7972,3443,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/pandemic-working-practices-expose-underfunded-cyber-defences,Pandemic working practices expose underfunded cyber defences,2021-08-03,,"Adopting to new working practices, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has businesses exposed to more and increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks and brought underfunded cyber defenses into the spotlight, according to the EY Global Information Security Survey 2021 (GISS).
This year's GISS, which surveyed more than 1,000 cybersecurity leaders at organisations worldwide, found that more than half (56%) say that businesses have sidestepped cyber processes to facilitate new requirements around remote or flexible working. At the same time, cyber leaders say they have never been as concerned as they are now about their ability to manage the cyber threat (43%) with more than three in four (77%) warning that they have seen an increase in the number of disruptive attacks, such as ransomware, over the last 12 months (compared to 59% in previous year’s GISS).
""The speed of change that businesses have had to adopt to this past year came with a heavy price,"" said Kris Lovejoy, cybersecurity leader at EY Global Consulting. ""The need to rapidly transform to survive meant that security was often overlooked. The risks of simply moving on, especially as businesses look to maintain some of these working practices in the post-COVID-19 era, without addressing these cyber gaps, are very real and increasingly urgent. Recent ransomware events only serve to underscore how critical immediate action is.""
Cybersecurity budgets are out of sync with need
Despite the growing threat of cyber attacks, cybersecurity budgets remain low relative to overall IT spend, according to this year’s GISS. While respondents’ organisations had average revenues of US$11bn in the last financial year, the average spend on cybersecurity was just US$5.28m.
Almost four in ten respondents (39%) warn that their organisation’s budget is below what is required to manage the new challenges that have arisen in the last 12 months. The same percentage say that cybersecurity expenses are not factored adequately into the cost of strategic investments, such as an IT supply chain transformation. At the same time, more than one-third (36%) say it is only a matter of time until their organisations suffer a major breach that could have been avoided had there been more appropriate investment in cybersecurity defences.
""The impact of underfunding and budget restrictions will be acutely felt as disruptive events become more frequent and more sophisticated,"" added Lovejoy"

""The impact of underfunding and budget restrictions will be acutely felt as disruptive events become more frequent and more sophisticated,"" added Lovejoy. ""Just like safety and security are part and parcel of any physical product development process, it can no longer be an afterthought in the development of digital products and services. Like night follows day, failure to introduce security in digital products and services will lead to an increase in the number of successful cybersecurity breaches.""
Building relationships with the C-suite can turn crisis into an opportunity
The essential relationships between cybersecurity leaders and other functions in the business, lack positivity and strength, according to the 2021 GISS.
Responding cyber leaders (41%) describe their relationship with the marketing function as negative, while 28% say their relationship with business owners is poor. As a result, while 36% of respondents in 2020 were confident that cybersecurity teams were being consulted at the planning stage of new business initiatives, this figure has fallen to 19% in 2021. Just 25% think senior business leaders would describe their organisation’s cybersecurity function as commercially minded.
""CISOs are central to an organisation’s efforts to transform and deliver long-term value,"" commented Errol Gardner, EY Global Vice Chair - Consulting. ""Investing in building a strategic relationship between CISOs, CEOs and the rest of the C-suite will help ensure that transformation programs are not only successful, but also implemented in a cyber-secure way for the organisation and its people. While CEOs are on a path to realise their vision and transform their business through technology, they can’t afford to turn a blind eye to the cyber risks this poses. At the same time, it falls on CISOs to ensure that CEOs have the right understanding of the value that investing in cybersecurity brings and that they recognise that as an integral part of the transformation journey."""

The company says that volante’s SEPA instant payments-as-a-service (PaaS) will provide all payment service providers (PSPs) certified access to the two principal pan-European schemes:

the Euro Banking Association’s EBA Clearing RT1 infrastructure (introduced in November 2017); and
the European Central Bank’s (ECB) TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), which launched last November.

Access will be via the high-speed, secure messaging and low-latency SIAnet network.
The new service is powered by VolPay, Volante’s ecosystem of business services for the entire payments lifecycle and allows any market participant to send and receive instant payments through TIPS and RT1, “avoiding costly and time-consuming in-house deployment of real-time payments (RTP) infrastructure projects,” according to the company.
“Institutions can instead focus on accelerating the delivery of new services to their end-customers, and speeding onboarding across a variety of retail and commercial use cases,” the company adds. “The service’s multi-network architecture ensures that institutions can easily support both today’s SEPA instant payments networks and future ones, without onerous rework.”
An ideal fit
Volante quotes David Bannister, senior analyst at Aite Group, who comments: “Managed service approaches are an ideal fit for instant payments.
“They allow providers to go live with very low volumes while they fine tune their business cases, but still preserve their ability to keep up with market demand as volumes rise. Because instant payments are new, no migration from existing systems is required, significantly reducing implementation times.”
Domenico Scaffidi, Volante’s director of business development, added, “Demand from European institutions for rapid access to instant payments capabilities is on the rise. We are excited to be expanding our payment processing managed service with SEPA instant payments capabilities to meet this demand and to be certified by SIAnet as a multi-network solution delivering more choice for our customers"

Janet Lewis, VP worldwide financial services, Microsoft, said, “Volante’s cloud-based payments services provide significant benefits to clients, and we are delighted they have chosen Microsoft Azure to host their SEPA instant PaaS.”
Last October, Volante announced that FIMBank Malta had signed as its first customer for the-then newly-launched cloud-based VolPay-as-a-Service offering.
Coup for SIA
In a separate announcement, Italy’s SIA confirmed that in partnership with Colt Technology Services, it has won a tender commissioned by the ECB for the provisioning of connectivity services allowing European central and commercial banks, central depositories, automated clearing houses and other PSPs to connect directly to Eurosystem market infrastructures through a single access interface Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway, aka ESMIG.  
The concession granted to SIA and Colt as network service providers for the ESMIG, commencing November 2021, will enable key organisations in the European financial system to access the platform for the settlement of large-value payments TARGET2, the TIPS instant payments settlement service, the securities settlement platform TARGET2-Securities (T2S), the Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS) and possibly other new services and applications.
Commenting on the award, SIA said that ESMIG is a fundamental component in the implementation of the TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities consolidation project, among the key proposals of Eurosystem’s ‘2020 Vision’ strategic plan for the evolution of market infrastructures. This project will entail savings for both those financial institutions that require more secure and reliable functionalities to be made available, and for the Eurosystem itself through reduced operating costs"

According to a report by the Hackett Group, the adoption of new technologies, including mobile computing, robotics (RPA), Cloud and artificial intelligence (AI), is a key factor. These digital technologies can reduce the cost of financial processes within large organisations by up to 35 per cent. The graph below shows that organisations considered to be 'top performers' or world-class, can reduce financial process costs by 21 per cent with a financial digital transformation. Their peers, companies that are not in the top-performer category, have an even greater opportunity to reduce the cost of their financial processes by up to 35 per cent.

The report – The Three Hallmarks of a World-Class Finance Organization – shows that the top-performers have a different approach to their adoption of digital technologies. This enables them to become more efficient and benefit from digital transformation opportunities. For example, the majority (91 per cent) of top performers agree or strongly agree that:

digital transformation will fundamentally change the operating model of our business; and that
digital transformation will fundamentally change our company's culture and our skills and talent needs.

3 paths to excellence and better financial metrics
According to Hackett Group, financial organisations achieve excellence through three pathways:

They become leaner and more agile by freeing up funds for redeployment elsewhere in the company, with the ability to scale up or down according to demand.
They adopt smart technologies and best practices by regularly re-examining their service model and investing in their people.
They focus on the needs of their customers and other stakeholders, so change takes place from the outside-in.

The adoption of digital technologies helps finance organisations achieve the above three objectives in the following ways:

finance costs (as percentage of revenue) are 44 per cent lower;
they employ 45 per cent fewer full-time employees;
error rates are 37 per cent lower; and
they spend 15 per cent less time collecting and compiling data"

Data from the report, which is designed to help banks benchmark their Probability of Default (PD) estimates against industry peers - and analyses long-term internal observed default rates and internal rating migration matrices from a portfolio of 26 leading financial institutions over a period of 15 years - show that bank loans have been performing well in recent years, but the figures are also consistent with fears of a corporate debt bubble.
An influx of newly issued corporate debt (so new as to be unlikely to already be defaulted) can have the effect of driving default ratios down, while, in practice, if this debt is issued by lower-rated companies, the underlying risk of default may well be increasing.
“While the numbers look good, there remains a risk of a credit bubble developing, as these historically low default rates could be explained by easier access to funding and higher debt levels, permitted by historically low rates and the necessity for banks to find yield,” says Richard Crecel, GCD’s executive director. “This is the calm before the storm - the quality of global debt seems to have slipped toward highly leveraged non-investment-grade companies and weaker covered instruments. The next default spike, whenever it occurs, could be significant.”
While banks will need to take steps to address these risks, the report shows that GCD member banks have been historically strong in this respect.
“Our data show that banks’ internal PD estimates used for regulatory purposes are typically conservative when compared to realised defaults,” says Daniela Thakkar from GCD’s Membership and Methodology Executive. “Average PD estimates over the last 15 years stand at 1.63% compared to an average default rate of 0.90% over the same period. To maintain this level of prudence and keep track of changing default risks, banks will need to continue benchmarking their PD-related calculations against industry peers. Traditionally, banks have compared their estimates to external benchmarks such as those produced by credit rating agencies (CRAs), but the GCD PD report provides a valuable and bespoke alternative"

Traditionally, banks have compared their estimates to external benchmarks such as those produced by credit rating agencies (CRAs), but the GCD PD report provides a valuable and bespoke alternative.”
The report includes data designed for benchmarking key risk processes within banks, including PD rating scale calibration, PD model calibration, regulatory and economic capital calculation and stress testing, among others.

About 80% of the companies participating in the Greenwich Associates 2020 Large Corporate Banking Study rate their banks’ performance during the crisis as 'excellent' or 'above average'. Those results stand in stark contrast to assessments by midsize companies and small businesses, many of whom felt abandoned by banks in the early stages of the pandemic. However, the fact that large companies were satisfied by the performance of most of their banks during the crisis means that the 20% of banks seen as coming up short could be at risk of losing business in the months to come.
Dissatisfaction will mean less business for some banks
Back in 2019, 49% of large companies said they expected to reduce the amount of business they do with at least one bank on their current list of providers. ""There is always some level of churn as part of the normal business cycle,"" said Greenwich Associates consultant Don Raftery. But that share jumped 10 percentage points in 2020 - an increase Raftery said is almost certainly associated with companies’ dissatisfaction with the support or capabilities they experienced, or didn’t, during the crisis.
When it comes to naming the banks that delivered during the crisis, large US companies put Bank of America, Citi and J.P. Morgan at the top of the list. Those three banks are the winners of the special 2020 Greenwich Excellence Award for “Helpfulness During COVID,” a designation won by banks that received the most citations from large companies for their high-quality service and support during the pandemic.

In late Q1 2020, companies feared they were in for a liquidity crisis like the one experienced in 2008. To prepare, they sought out new sources of liquidity. In most cases, that supplemental liquidity proved to be a prudent but ultimately unnecessary backstop, as funding for large companies quickly returned to something close to normal. By summer, much of the new liquidity had found its way back onto bank balance sheets, and companies were looking for advice on what to do with increased cash positions. 
“However, none of that was apparent in February and March, and companies will have long memories about the responses they got from banks when they asked for additional credit to help them weather the crisis,” commented Greenwich Associates consultant Chris McDonnell.
Credit was not the only thing companies needed. The switch to work from home created unprecedented operational challenges for companies and their treasury departments. Companies participating in the annual study say bank performance varied widely during the crisis in key functions like cash management. According to study participants, some banks went above and beyond to facilitate the switch to work from home. “The fact that banks like Bank of America, Citi, J.P"

The switch to work from home created unprecedented operational challenges for companies and their treasury departments. Companies participating in the annual study say bank performance varied widely during the crisis in key functions like cash management. According to study participants, some banks went above and beyond to facilitate the switch to work from home. “The fact that banks like Bank of America, Citi, J.P. Morgan, PNC, and Wells Fargo managed to improve client ratings for ‘ease of doing business’ in cash management during such a disruptive period is a notable accomplishment,” said McDonnell.
However, companies say other banks actually created additional headaches, with strict documentation and other requirements that were difficult to meet in a remote work environment. Frustrations with these providers’ performance during the crisis likely stem from broader criticisms of cash management being onerous in general. Fewer than one in three large companies reported that their cash management provider is 'easy to work with'. The remaining two-thirds of study respondents complain about poor customer service and operational breakdowns. KYC compliance is one key pain point that contributes to low scores for overall client satisfaction across the industry - both during the pandemic and in a more normal business environment. Digitalisation of these processes will help as more banks get further along in the journey.
Digital capabilities approaching escape velocity
Most of the banks that came through for large companies during the crisis have one thing in common: a solid digital platform in place coming into 2020 that allowed them to maintain product and service quality during the pandemic. Digital technology is becoming the lynchpin of a wholesale banking franchise - particularly in areas like cash management - and banks with the best digital platforms are building a powerful competitive advantage.
Bank of America and J.P. Morgan won the 2020 Greenwich Excellence Award for Best Overall Digital Platform in Large Corporate Cash Management. At a broader level, four global wholesale banks have differentiated themselves by deploying strong digital/technical capabilities and analytics that outpace rivals: Bank of America, Citi, HSBC, and J.P. Morgan. 
“Wherever they are on their digital transformation journey - automation, point solutions, wholescale infrastructure change - our clients look to us to help them navigate the accelerating pace of change and position their business to diversify, securely grow and thrive,” said Lia Cao, head of Wholesale Payments Solutions & NAMR Corporate Sales at J.P. Morgan"

Morgan.
The bad news for banks not making these lists is that the full impact of past digital investments - many of which are now being targeted as back-office efficiency enhancements - has not yet materialised. As customers start to feel the impact of new digital initiatives, the competitive landscape of the entire industry will begin to shift. 
“There’s an element of escape velocity,” noted Raftery. “Right now, some banks are using traditional ‘white-glove’ service to remain competitive. However, we are approaching (or, in certain cases, past) the point where the efficiency and cost advantages of the digital platforms become overwhelming. At that point, it’s hard to see how digital laggards can keep up.”
What does ESG mean in corporate treasury and finance?
As growing numbers of companies and investors adopt environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards into their operations, corporate treasury professionals are still trying to figure out exactly what ESG means in specific functions like cash management and in corporate finance more broadly. As part of that process, 21% of the large US companies participating in the study say they have started considering banks’ performance on ESG factors and provision of sustainable finance options like 'green bonds' when allocating their banking wallet. 
“Although that share falls slightly short of the more than one-quarter seen in Europe, the fact that a significant number of the biggest US companies say ESG now plays a role in awarding bank business shows just how fast these issues are permeating business and finance in North America,” said Raftery.
Indeed, as corporate treasury officials consider the implications of ESG on their own policies and operations, they should not forget that the new emphasis on these issues goes both ways. 
“Companies should be prepared for their banks’ credit decisions to start taking into account ESG factors like carbon risk in terms of regulations, taxes, potential fines, and even long-term revenue prospects,” concluded Raftery"

From June to December 2020, Greenwich Associates conducted interviews at US-based companies with US$2bn or more in annual revenue with 301 chief financial officers, treasurers and assistant treasurers, 346 cash managers and other financial professionals in cash management, and 110 corporate trade finance professionals. Participants were asked about market trends and their relationships with their banks.

He knew exactly what he was striving for. Peter Drucker famously wrote, “Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.” (He had another version of this thought, “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.”) 
But what are the ‘right things’ in corporate treasury? Today, the new technologies allow the corporate treasury department to cover a huge range of areas, but should they?
Being more strategic is not a solution, it is the beginning of the analysis
The first problem is that there is no agreement as to what is “treasury”? Marcel Win commented on our item on outsourcing, see, that: “if you ask 20 treasurers across the globe (to define treasury), you will get at least 21 different answers.”
What to do
Marcel Win believes that the main corporate treasury tasks are, “Managing the relationships to their bank, securing the funding of the company and support strategic moves like M&A.” But again, many corporate treasurers would have different views.
PwC in their Global Corporate Treasury Benchmarking Survey 2017 Sebastian de Paolo commented ""that today the success of the treasury profession is dependent on how well it adapts to - and operates in - an increasingly virtual environment.” And that “More than ever, treasury professionals have to be jacks of all trades to succeed in today’s environment.” The problem with this view is that it excuses a lack of focus. 
On the other hand, PwC see only three main tasks for corporate treasury: managing funding, liquidity and financial risk, but many corporate treasurers would add more tasks to these three items.
Wikipedia write that “Treasury management (or treasury operations) includes management of an enterprise's holdings, with the ultimate goal of managing the firm's liquidity and mitigating its operational, financial and reputational risk.”

Deciding what to NOT do in corporate treasury is even more difficult now that the new technologies allow corporate treasury departments to be in contact with almost any process or system in the company and in the financial world. 
What are the criteria? Should it be:

Where corporate treasury department adds value (but what is value?)
When no-one else is doing the work effectively (Not always a good reason)
Because we are good at it?
Does it contribute to our key role in the company?

Corporate treasurers can only answer these questions if they have a clear idea as to what the corporate treasury department’s real business is. This will enable them to identify what they should do and what they should not do.

The Treasury Select Committee (TSC) has published its report on economic crime – Anti-money laundering supervision and sanctions implementation – whose findings include the following:

The UK needs a more precise estimate of the scale of economic crime in the country, which is anywhere from “tens of billions” to “hundreds of billions” of pounds.
The UK government should review AML supervision more regularly, with a single supervisor of the 25 UK bodies that enforce AML rules. This could create a role for the newly-announced Economic Crime Strategic Board, jointly chaired by the chancellor of the exchequer and the home secretary.
The UK must not compromise in the fight against economic crime to secure trade deals post-Brexit. The anticipated increase in trade with non-European Union (EU) countries will increase the risk that UK businesses will encounter markets with lower AML standards.
Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) should require all estate agents to be registered with them for AML purposes, to ensure that any proceeds from corruption aren’t stashed in property.
Companies House, where new firms are registered, needs powers to ensure it plays no role in assisting those involved in economic crime.
The government is criticised for failure to reform the corporate criminal liability framework for economic crime.

Resisting pressure
“With the uncertainties of Brexit around the corner, the government should regularly review the UK’s effort to combat money laundering to ensure a constant stimulus to improve,” said TSC chair Nicky Morgan.
“The government must ensure it does not bow to buccaneering deregulatory pressures and maintain its intentions to lead in the fight against economic crime.”
“Leading that fight is going to require focus. The Government needs to bring greater order to a fragmented supervisory system, better identify the scale of the problem, and make a greater effort to combat the known risks and gaps in the supervisory system.

The message for delegates attending this week’s climate risk summit in London, hosted by The Economist magazine, wasn’t remorselessly pessimistic but it was still sobering. If present trends continue unabated, wildfires, floods and heatwaves that are already a regular occurrence around the world will have moved beyond safe limits by the year 2050, causing millions of premature deaths.
Water and its availability will increasingly become an issue for much of the world’s population, which reached 7.7 billion in April 2019 and could have reached 10 billion by mid-century.

Jonathan Baillie, executive vice president and chief scientist for National Geographic magazine, says that avoiding disaster will require securing what is left of the world’s forests and oceans, which currently absorb around 60% of harmful CO2 emissions.
Next year, Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in south-west China will be the venue for a conference to decide the post-2020 biodiversity framework for the planet. It will be based on ensuring that 30% of the world is protected by the year 2030 with a further 20% either maintained or restored to a natural state and designated as climate stabilisation areas.
Baillie said that central to this plan is “maintaining the sponge that absorbs CO2” as the only alternative to inaction is catastrophe.
Ambitious targets
The conference coincided with this week’s unveiling of the government’s Green Finance strategy. Harriett Baldwin, minister of state for Africa at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and minister of state at the Department for International Development said that the aim is to unlock a private pool of assets valued at up to US$190 trillion.

He said that climate change risk has influenced investment in certain sectors but hadn’t yet made too much of an impact on the ‘big money’, although the country’s sizeable Sovereign Wealth Fund is no longer investing in gas and oil exploration companies and is seeking to diversify its investment portfolio.
The two countries have also introduced carbon pricing policies, although Norway’s has so far proved more effective in gearing up technologies than causing a shift in investment policies. “Things are moving too slowly,” the minister admitted. “We have maybe 20 years, certainly 30 at the maximum to push through radical change and not 100.”
Sarah Breeden, executive director for international banks supervision at the Bank of England (BoE) spoke of how the Bank had raised awareness in 2015 of the risks posed to the insurance sector by climate change and followed up last year with a similar exercise for the banking sector.
The climate focused Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) was formed two years ago by the BoE and seven other central banks and released its first major report into climate-related financial risks in April this year. Membership has steadily grown to 40 banks, although significantly the US Federal Reserve has yet to join.
The BoE is now seeking to become more prescriptive and instil best practice in outlining various climate change scenarios for which the UK financial system should prepare for. An initiative for stress testing a range of scenarios is planned for a 2020-21 launch.
“If a system isn’t resilient, what steps are planned to build up its strength?” said Breeden. “We want people to look not just one or two years ahead, but over the coming decades.”

With the Trump administration pulling the US out of the Paris agreement on coordinated climate change action, Alice Hill a policymaker at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, former judge and adviser to former president Obama spoke on “the aha moment” that had spurred his team into action. This came with superstorm Sandy in late October 2012, which hit 24 states.
Manhattan, whose defences were built to resist up to 12 feet of storm surge, was submerged by one of 14 feet. Barriers were breached, a power sub-station blew up and supplies to eight million citizens were interrupted. Wastewater treatment plants and transport systems failed, while hospitals were forced to cancel operations and evacuate 6,500 patients.
“One building escaped unscathed – Goldman Sachs’ officers were a totem of resilience even though its employees couldn’t get to work,” said Hill. “But we’ve got so behind in our preparations since then and the financial system is simply unprepared for another event like Sandy.
“What’s worse is the lack of any resilient building code for Southeast Asia, where new cities the size of Manhattan are under construction.”
More positive news is that since the landmark Paris agreement was signed in late 2015, an operational rulebook to drive genuine climate change action has been drawn up and was launched at a summit in Katowice, Poland last December.
“The Paris process lives on, although it’s not the same with the US missing, said Todd Stern, former US envoy for climate change. “Other countries remain committed and will now begin to ramp up their targets.
“The danger is that the with the US now unlikely to meet the 2015 target, others may also relax their efforts. Against this, New York state has just passed its own ambitious targets, California also has a very strong emissions reduction programme and many other states and following these leads.”
Stern referred to the “zeitgeist moment” nearly 50 years ago, when the first Earth Day was marked in April 197o by 20 million Americans taking to the streets to demand a healthier and more sustainable environment and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was formed later that year.

He also discussed the ways regulators around the world can coordinate to make MMFs more resilient in future.
Bailey noted that the global Financial Stability Board (FSB), had analysed last March’s so-called 'dash for cash' in its Holistic Review published at the end of last year, highlighting a number of vulnerabilities in non-bank finance and setting out some considerations for reforms required to tackle the issues that arose, with MMFs being one of the issues at the top of that list.
Background to the issues posed by MMFs
Following the credit crunch and global financial crisis of 2007-08, considerable work was undertaken to build the resilience of MMFs. In 2012 the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) published policy recommendations for the regulation and management of MMFs. 
""Many of the reforms that were subsequently implemented have helped improve the resilience of MMFs, however it is clear they did not go far enough in solving the underlying problems,"" Bailey said. ""And in some cases they may have had unintended consequences, such as the introduction of a link between the level of illiquid assets held by a fund and the potential use of tools (such as fees or gates) to manage redemptions during periods of stress. While introduced to manage potentially disruptive outflows, these changes have made funds more sensitive to so-called cliff edge effects - thus increasing an incentive to exit before the gate closes.""
Reflecting on the various kinds of investment funds, Bailey noted that most are not meant to be cash-like, in the sense that the promise is to return the fruits of the investment strategy, which may be more or less than the amount invested. Cash-like certainty of value is not part of the contract.
""There are at least two problems which are evident in how this system operates – or possibly two variants of the same problem,"" Bailey commented. ""First, there are instruments which at least in some of their existing forms are neither one thing nor the other – neither properly cash-like nor properly investment-like. Second, there are instruments which are meant to be investment-like but which become regarded as cash-like"

""First, there are instruments which at least in some of their existing forms are neither one thing nor the other – neither properly cash-like nor properly investment-like. Second, there are instruments which are meant to be investment-like but which become regarded as cash-like.""
He made the point that there are structural vulnerabilities in the financial system caused by both of these problems in the non-bank world. The dash for cash episode that occurred in March 2020 as a result of the global pandemic was the sort of stress event that nearly caused the problems to crystallise in a big way, and arguably would have done so but for the rapid intervention on a substantial scale by the authorities.
Lessons from the dash for cash episode
""The dash for cash was a broader financial system - and indeed economy wide - phenomenon, driven by the underlying health shock and its economic implications,"" Bailey pointed out. ""Nonetheless, money market funds are an important part of the dash for cash story because they seek to bridge between the desire of investors for immediate liquidity (in other words a cash or deposit-like desire) and the desire of the banks, in which they invest a sizeable part of the funds, for term funding in the form of commercial paper or certificates of deposit. They are therefore carrying out a form of maturity transformation which in times of stress can become prone to runs.""
In total, sterling money market funds saw outflows of around £25bn; or 10% of their total assets, in the eight days between 12th and 20th March last year. At first, the outflows were met by running down their holdings of cash, but as the outflows increased, they sought to liquidate some of their bank assets - CDs and CP. But they found that the market for those assets - which typically comes primarily from dealers buying back their own paper - was closed. The dash for cash meant that the tide was flowing fast against them.
As the regulatory system currently works, if MMFs’ liquid asset ratios fall towards prescribed thresholds, and they are unable to top up their liquid assets (cash) through sales, they are able to ‘gate’ or impose fees on investors, in other words decline to provide immediate liquidity"

As with banks, the broader danger of this situation - which is a threat to financial stability - is that such a problem in one fund could trigger contagion to other funds, through fear that they might have the same problem, and thus lead to a highly destabilising run on money market funds. These thresholds can, therefore, also affect the behaviour of fund managers, making liquidity buffers not usable in times of stress, for fear this would fuel investors’ desire to run.
Another consequence of the rising demand for cash, and the failure to meet that demand by selling assets, was a sharp rise in money market rates. The rise was sharpest at longer money market-tenors, but there was also a pickup in overnight repo rates. 
""This was a particularly serious sign of market dysfunction in what are core markets, and a serious challenge to our ability to implement monetary policy by keeping these rates broadly aligned to the official Bank Rate,"" explained Bailey. ""It resulted in an increase in the cost and reduction in the availability of credit - to the financial system, other companies and households - precisely at the time they needed it most. There was therefore a serious threat to both monetary policy and financial stability, in other words both of the core purposes of a central bank. It was an existential moment.""
The BoE took two actions which eased the pressure, and did so quickly. First, on 19 March, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to buy gilts in large size and at high speed. At its peak the pace of gilt purchases reached £13.5bn per week, more than twice as fast as in early 2009. Bailey said that the use of this broad monetary policy tool was warranted given the widespread nature of the dash for cash, and the implications of the pandemic for the economic outlook. Other central banks took similar decisions around the same time. This helped to stabilise markets and reversed the dash for cash and thus the flows out of money market funds"

Other central banks took similar decisions around the same time. This helped to stabilise markets and reversed the dash for cash and thus the flows out of money market funds. Second, the BoE activated its Contingent Term Repo Facility on 24 March, committing to lend unlimited amounts of reserves at close to Bank Rate against a broad range of collateral. Taken together, these operations brought money market rates back to more normal levels. The Federal Reserve in the US also launched a specific liquidity facility aimed at easing the stresses in dollar denominated MMFs.
While these actions tackled the immediate problem, some serious issues that represent a threat to the stability of the financial system were revealed during the episode, which is why Bailey is pitching certain reforms aimed at making MMFs more resilient. 
Reforms to make MMFs more resilient
The objective of the proposed reforms is to improve the resilience and functioning of MMFs to protect the stability of the financial system. The fact that this is happening little over a decade since the financial crisis points to the reforms that occurred after that event as failing to tackle this issue conclusively. 
In his speech, Bailey set out the following five key principles that should shape the necessary changes to MMFs: 

As a general principle for all funds - investment and money market - redemption terms should be aligned with the underlying liquidity of assets.
Where investors regard funds as cash-like, they should be made resilient so they can operate as such at all times, which means running minimal maturity mismatch risk.
Money market funds should not hold less liquid assets on a scale that would make them more suitable to be traditional investment funds.
Money market funds should not be designed with regulatory thresholds or cliff-edges which create adverse incentives and amplify first-mover advantage behaviour.
Reforms should improve the ability of funds to support short-term funding markets, including by making them more resilient"

Money market funds should not be designed with regulatory thresholds or cliff-edges which create adverse incentives and amplify first-mover advantage behaviour.
Reforms should improve the ability of funds to support short-term funding markets, including by making them more resilient.

Bailey also outlined what he called three 'big picture changes' which follow from these principles, and should form the basis of the necessary reforms:
""First, we should remove the adverse incentives introduced by the liquidity thresholds related to the use of suspensions, gates and redemption fees. Second, we should simplify the landscape to make clearer the critical distinction between cash-like funds and investment funds. We should remove the ambiguity of intermediate descriptions such as low volatility funds. Third, and to support removing the ambiguity, it will be important to define in an accounting and substantive sense more explicitly what constitutes cash-like. Current guidance leaves a lot of judgement to managers and auditors to make these decisions on a fund by fund basis.""
Next steps
The FSB will shortly be consulting on what reforms would be most appropriate. Bailey noted that the Bank of England remains very supportive of the work being taken forward by the FSB and under the Italian G20 presidency. 
""Given the cross-border nature of MMFs, it is important we work together internationally to ensure that we are aligned in our objectives, and adhering to common principles, even if the precise implementation varies a little to reflect the specific nature of each jurisdiction’s markets,"" Bailey concluded. ""The dash for cash provided an unwelcome reminder that the post financial crisis did not finish the job and left a dangerous gap in our exposure to the risk of financial instability. We must finish the task this time."""

This had an immediate impact on our customers and affected many important payment processes including salary and pension payments, repayment of loans, intercompany funding and merchant sales proceeds. “We immediately looked at the payment orders that had been received overnight, reviewed with the local team our ability to settle them and then completed these payments,” reports Deutsche Bank’s David Cooper, head of transactional FX sales for Asia Pacific. “We took the decision to continue to accept payment orders, using a controlled process to review the flow on a daily basis with trading as DB’s own PHP liquidity would need to be used while the interbank market remained closed.” Johnny Grimes, managing director, global head of liquidity product, Transactional FX and head of Corporate Bank Ireland at Deutsche Bank adds that communications went from Asia to the Bank’s global coverage team and their clients within hours of the Manila shutdown being announced. “A plan was also put in place to handle further clients transactions that we would expect to see going forward. “Thankfully, the closure was brief and clients felt minimal impact as we had managed their flows incredibly well. Truly a global effort to manage what was a very difficult market infrastructure challenge.” David Lynne, Deutsche Bank’s head of corporate bank and fixed income and currencies in Asia Pacific adds: “This swift response and our focus on business continuity has supported our customers during the Covid-19 pandemic.” ""Our clients can attest to our ability to be there when it matters.”""David Lynne, Deutsche Bank’s head of corporate bank and fixed income and currencies in Asia Pacific"

There are hopes that pressure on global supply chains will ease as Shanghai fully reopens later this week from a Covid-19 lockdown that has largely immobilised the city and its port since March.
China’s most populous city, will ease testing requirements from Wednesday for people who want to enter public areas, said city government spokeswoman Yin Xin, adding these moves should encourage work resumption.
“The current epidemic situation in the city continues to stabilise and improve,” Yin said, adding Shanghai’s strategy was now “pivoting towards normalised prevention and control.” Bus services within the Pudong New Area, home to Shanghai’s largest airport and the main financial district, will fully resume from today, officials said.
Shanghai’s port, which is the world’s largest and handles one-fifth of China’s shipping volumes, has been operating over the period, but a sharply reduced capacity. Many shipments have either been cancelled, postponed or rerouted to other Chinese mega-ports such as Ningbo-Zhousan.
With the return to normal activities scheduled for 1 June, the port is set to move into overdrive as manufacturers try to fulfil backlogs, with serious knock-on effects around the world. The authorities have been slowly relaxing curbs, with a focus on resuming manufacturing. Shanghai has already allowed key manufacturers in the auto industry, life sciences, chemicals and semiconductors to resume production since late April.
More citizens have been allowed outdoors, and more businesses permitted to reopen, though many residents remain largely confined to their housing compounds, and most shops limited to deliveries.
The authorities approved 240 financial institutions in the city for reopening from Wednesday, state-run Shanghai Securities News reported at the weekend, adding to a list of 864 firms released earlier this month. That is out of a total of around 1,700 financial firms in Shanghai.
The newspaper reported on Saturday that more than 10,000 bankers and traders who have been living and working in their offices since the start of lockdown were gradually returning home.
Shanghai is also a major manufacturing hub, so the lockdowns have had a significant impact, with US tech multinational Cisco warning of disruption to supplies of parts it needs for power supplies. Other major corporates such as Foxconn, Tesla, and Toyota, have all ceased or slowed production"

Shanghai is also a major manufacturing hub, so the lockdowns have had a significant impact, with US tech multinational Cisco warning of disruption to supplies of parts it needs for power supplies. Other major corporates such as Foxconn, Tesla, and Toyota, have all ceased or slowed production. Chinese chipmaker SMIC maintained some production output by having staff move either into its plants, or into a Covid-free zone surrounding them.
The city has offered some tax rebates for companies and allowed all manufacturers to resume operations from the start of June as the authorities roll out a range of policies to restart an economy impacted by the Covid lockdowns.
The financial hub will accelerate approvals for property projects and supply new residential developments, according to a plan issued by the Shanghai municipal government. The quota for car ownership this year will be increased by 40,000, a purchase tax for some passenger vehicles will be reduced and subsidies will be given to electric car buyers.
Shanghai’s administrators have also announced subsidy schemes for industries including software development. Free or low-cost broadband services for small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is another stimulus initiative. Some SMEs will be eligible for free software that it is hoped will accelerate their digital transformation efforts.
The city’s government even hopes that the lockdowns will see businesses accelerate development of digital pandemic-management tools.
Hong Kong finance chief defends security law
China’s wide-ranging security law for Hong Kong, imposed nearly two years ago following prolonged social unrest in 2019, has further consolidated the city's role as an international financial centre, according to Paul Chan Mo-po, financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR).
In his weekly blog, Chan claimed that the law, which took effect at the end of June 2020 and makes it easier to punish protesters while also reducing Hong Kong's autonomy, has restored stability and safety to the city after the unrest, and that people's rights and freedoms are now better protected.
“The figures say it all. Initial public offering (IPO) funds raised in Hong Kong exceeded HK$650 billion (US$82"

“The figures say it all. Initial public offering (IPO) funds raised in Hong Kong exceeded HK$650 billion (US$82.8 billion) since the implementation of the law, accounting for an increase of more than 30% from the same period before the enactment of the law,” he wrote.
“After years of political turmoil in Hong Kong caused by foreign and external forces, and the ‘black violence’ in 2019, the Hong Kong national security law has safeguarded the security of the country and Hong Kong … and created a safe and stable environment for society.”
Average daily turnover in the local stock market jumped almost 60%, compared with the 12-month period before the law came into effect, reaching HK$150 billion.
Chan also referred to the war in Ukraine, which he used as an opportunity to attack the US rather than Russia. As a fully open international financial centre, Hong Kong must make different preparations and plans for various risks as the geopolitical situation continues to be tense, he noted.
“The recent Russia-Ukraine conflict has made people realise how the US would weaponise its own currency and certain international financial systems to twist and interfere with the operation of the international financial market,” Chan claimed.
“We must clearly recognise the fundamental truth that national security is the premise of economic development, and economic development is the guarantee of national security.”

The finance chief also announced also that HKSAR authorities will further simplify rules on secondary listings for US-listed Chinese companies and make more efforts to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as a bridge between the Chinese mainland and the rest of the world.
Chan suggested that this contrasted with the recent intensifying crackdown by the US government on Chinese companies listed in the US and would further deter companies from seeking IPOs in the US and accelerate the process for US-listed Chinese companies shifting toward the mainland or Hong Kong markets.
Since 2019, a total of 21 US-listed Chinese stocks have shifted to Hong Kong through secondary listings or dual listings, Chan said, accounting for over 70% of the total value of all US-listed Chinese stocks in terms of market capitalisation"

In October 2021, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing (HKEX) introduced A50, its equity index futures contract tracking the MSCI China A50 Connect Index to make it easier for international investors to bet on Chinese stocks. Although Hong Kong is beginning to make inroads analysts suggest that rival Singapore Exchange (SGX), which has had a monopoly since 2006, still commands 95% of volume.
Chan suggested that China’s influence and the institutional advantages of the “one country, two systems” policy allowed Hong Kong to build a path for successful development amid the changing international environment and that connectivity is one of Hong Kong’s unique advantages that other markets find difficult to copy. Initiatives have included the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, to the Bond Connect - a mutual bond access programme between the mainland and Hong Kong.
Separately the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced that it has agreed to include exchange-traded funds in stock connect programmes with Hong Kong. The formal launch date will be announced later, as preparations will take about two months.
Hong Kong’s next leader, chief executive-elect John Lee Ka-chiu, is visiting Beijing and is expected to meet President Xi Jinping today as he accepts his appointment letter as the special administrative region’s (SAR) next leader from Premier Li Keqiang.
Lee, who officially takes office at the end of June, is a former police officer and security chief who oversaw the crackdown on Hong Kong’s democracy movement. He was named by Beijing as successor to Carrie Lam earlier this month.
Paraguay bill regulates crypto mining and trading
Cryptocurrency regulation in Paraguay is progressing steadily. A crypto bill introduced in the Senate last December was approved last week with some modifications by the country’s Chamber of Representatives and would regulate cryptocurrency mining and trading.

The legislation aims to attract international miners to Paraguay, which has cheap electricity costs at around 5 cents per kilowatt hour, so cryptocurrency mining poses a lucrative opportunity for the country. Analysts expect that more South American countries where currency devaluation is a prominent issue will follow suit.
Should the Paraguay bill become law, individual and corporate miners will have to request authorisation for industrial electricity consumption and then apply for a licence. The proposal also creates a registry for any individual or legal entity aiming to provide crypto trading or custody services for third parties, although the concept of exchange is not included.
Russia imposes curbs on Intesa and UniCredit units
Russia’s central bank has imposed temporary restrictions on the current accounts of Italian individuals and companies that bank with the local units of Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit, according to reports.
Both lenders received letters from the Bank of Russia stating that from 25 May for a period of one year, Italian individuals and firms with accounts at the two lenders’ Russian units cannot withdraw funds without permission from their local management. Those individuals and companies will be barred from opening new accounts, according to individuals who asked to remain anonymous.
Deposits that lift an account's balance above €100,000 euros (US$107,150) are also banned, in a measure matching one imposed by the European Union on Russian nationals, the sources said. Also, Italian companies and citizens who do not have a Russian residency permit would not be allowed to open new accounts, they added.

India plans graded approach for introducing digital currency
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that it intends to adopt a graded approach to the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or digital rupee.
“The Reserve Bank is engaged in the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in India. The design of CBDC needs to be in conformity with the stated objectives of monetary policy, financial stability and efficient operations of currency and payment systems,” the bank declared in its 2021-22 annual report.
The RBI added that it has been exploring the pros and cons of introducing a digital rupee and the appropriate design elements of CBDCs that could be implemented with little, or no disruption are under examination.

Ripple CEO says IPO again under consideration
Ripple’s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse says that the possibility of an initial public offering (IPO) once the ongoing lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the network ends. The SEC alleges that Ripple conducted an illegal securities offering through sales of XRP, the world’s sixth-biggest cryptocurrency.
The payments giant – which has both competed against and partnered with SWIFT in recent years – has long been considering an IPO and in an interview with CNBC Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple will again explore the possibility once the SEC’s lawsuit against XRP ends. The action has been ongoing for nearly 15 months, but Garlinghouse expects it to end later this year. he told CNBC.
“I think we want to get certainty and clarity in the United States with the US SEC,” he commented. “You know, I'm hopeful that the SEC will not slow that process down any more than they already have.”
XRP has been used to facilitate cross-border payments and convert it to fiat, which considerably lowers the transaction cost.

Westpac NZ strengthens liquidity risk management
Westpac New Zealand has been commended by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand “for moving in the right direction” to improve the management of its liquidity risks and surrounding culture, which the RBNZ had strongly criticised in March 2021.
A new independent report, prepared by Deloitte, found that Westpac NZ’s repatriation of its liquidity model from its parent to New Zealand and other risk management enhancements have led to an overall improvement in its liquidity control environment.
“We are encouraged to see that Westpac NZ has taken the necessary steps to improve its liquidity risk management and risk culture by increasing its resourcing and improving its governance processes,” said deputy governor Christian Hawkesby.
“We expect that the momentum built to date will allow Westpac NZ to continue the overall transition from a reactive, to a proactive risk culture.”
Back in March 2021 the RBNZ raised concerns around Westpac NZ’s risk governance processes, citing “material failures to report liquidity correctly” and operating “outside of its own risk settings for technology for a number of years”.
The RBNZ required the bank to provide two independent reports to provide assurance that the actions it takes to improve the management of liquidity risks, and the culture that enabled repeated compliance failures, prove effective. Until it was satisfied that the remediation work was complete and effective, the RBNZ increased Westpac NZ’s required holding of liquid assets.
An earlier independent report on Westpac NZ’s risk governance, published last November by management consulting firm Oliver Wyman, found little improvement.
“The report’s findings highlighted material risks to effective risk governance and noted that the role played by the board fell short of the standard expected of an organisation of the bank’s scope and scale,” said RBNZ’s deputy governor and general manager of financial stability at the time, Geoff Bascand"

“The report found there had been historic underinvestment in risk management capabilities at the bank with investment appearing reactive, rather than strategic.”
Deloitte’s more recent, more positive report should help improve relations between the RBNZ and Westpac, which reached a low in March 2021 when Westpac said it was considering a demerger of its New Zealand subsidiary in response to the RBNZ sanctions and the county’s new stringent capital rules.
Three months later Westpac backtracked on its demerger threat by announcing that it would retain full ownership of its New Zealand business, after a review found the such a move would not be in the best interests of its shareholders"

Although there are great differences of opinion about what will happen, ranging from the euro will disappear to no countries leaving the euro. The one thing they all agree about is that a multidisciplinary task force - made up of treasury, HR, sales and operations, and business units - is needed to work out what the implications are for their group AND develop plans as to what to do in each possible scenario. They have all also set up a permanent team/project to monitor, manage and coordinate their group's reaction.
Most corporates now have their plans in place and are ready to react. Actions that corporates have already taken, include:

daily sweeping all euros from key countries; others sweep all euros from the whole eurozone
opened alternative or backup bank accounts
developed alternative local lines of credit
changed point of sale systems and services to cater for the new currencies
at least worked how to change the ERP systems if a new currency is created
set up a myriad of alternative ways to continue to pay staff (which include using Visa or MasterCard credit card accounts for employees) and to pay key suppliers
reviewed the implications for most/all of their legal contracts.

All corporates are agreed that the changeover period, most are expecting it to be over a weekend, will be very difficult, and it is then that the alternative arrangements they have made will be vital.
All companies are aware of the possible treasury risks and impacts: on receivables and payables, of re-denomination, changes to contract law, and credit risk - possible loss of cash and ability to withdraw existing credit facilities. However, it is interest rate, credit and counter-party risk, for banks and suppliers, that is of the most enduring concern:

She believes that the possibility of Greece exiting the Euro and introducing a new currency is neither impossible nor highly improbable. However, if it does happen, she believes that:

the abrupt reduction in wage costs, if it is accompanied by structural reforms and opening of the economy, would most probably be beneficial and the Group would jump start fast"

Currencycloud has announced a pilot programme to provide SWIFT gpi tracking capabilities to their clients through a new API. This service, one of the first offered by a non-bank, will allow Currencycloud clients to track their customers’ cross-border payments directly. They can also pass the service further onwards to their own customers so they can track their payments themselves.
SWIFT gpi technology tracks a payment as it moves around the world and is able to identify where it is being held, or where it may have failed, in a matter of seconds – immediately removing the need to contact a banking partner, or the need for further investigation. Since the introduction of SWIFT gpi, 60% of failed payments made through Currencycloud are traced and resolved in less than one day, often in minutes. Prior to SWIFT gpi, Currencyloud estimates that 80% of failed payments on its platform would take more than seven days to resolve due to a laborious administrative process - this has been reduced to less than 5% with this new technology.

The additional funding was a planned extension from the company’s initial seed round co-led by FINTOP Capital, who also participated. The final tranche was oversubscribed as a result of the company gaining significant traction with customers, capping off its seed round.
The investment marks one year since the company officially launched its product. During that time, Trovata has nearly doubled its customers and annual recurring revenue (ARR), quarter over quarter. The company’s product automates cash-centric workflows, which is designed to allow small, medium, and large corporate finance and treasury teams to gain better visibility into their cash flow.
“APIs are transforming how banks and clients collaborate and innovate across wholesale banking,” said Jason Tiede, managing director and global head of Innovation, Wholesale Payments for J.P. Morgan. “Clients are looking for a better way to visualise and analyse cash flows and the need for such a solution has become even more germane given the unprecedented volatility in our global economy.”
 
Danske Bank green loans slashed 532,039 tonnes of CO2 in 2019
Danske Bank and Realkredit Danmark provided DKK7bn in green loans to corporate customers in 2019, which resulted in 532,039 tonnes of avoided CO2. The projects the pair funded with green loans included an offshore wind farm, four electric ferries, improvement of more than 30 Nordic hydropower plants, a green and energy-efficient residential building with 300 apartments, and the improvement of a recycling plant. 
Recently, Danske Bank published its first Green Bond Impact report, which provides an overview of the environmental impact of its green loans granted to corporate customers in 2019. One of the customers that used a green loan to finance an initiative with a clear environmental impact is Finnish Kemijoki Oy, a producer of hydropower and regulating power in Finland. The green loan provided by Danske Bank will improve more than 20 existing hydropower plants"

ANZ establishing business hotline for government COVID-19 payments
ANZ has announced it will establish a dedicated hotline to help small and medium business customers who are eligible for the Federal Government’s Job Keeper payments. The bank will implement a process to identify which customers need this assistance and prioritise their funding requests until their payments arrive. The Australian Taxation Office is scheduled to make the first payments under the Federal Government’s Job Keeper program in early May.
ANZ has already provided more than 6300 small and medium enterprise (SME) customers with a 10% increase on their overdraft accounts, which has helped alleviate some of the financial pressure and provided support until Job Keeper payments arrive. The bank has also provided loan repayment deferrals to about 15% of its SME customers. It is also offering loans for business customers that are 50% guaranteed by Federal Government for up to $250,000 as another way to help them through this challenging time"

Banks are working together on trade finance applications based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and recent reports show that blockchain will have more of an impact – and will mean more savings for banks – than previously thought.
Reduced infrastructure costs for banks
A study by Accenture and McLagan (part of Aon plc) suggests that blockchain technology could reduce infrastructure costs for eight of the world’s 10 largest investment banks by an average of 30 per cent. This could mean annual savings of $8-12 billion, the report said. McLagan's Chris Blain said: “This joint analysis with Accenture suggests that blockchain technology could significantly change the cost structure of investment banks over the next decade. The technology represents a potentially important breakthrough at a time when leading investment banks are looking at myriad ways to rebuild their returns on equity.”
Savings in four areas
The Accenture/McLagan report explains that blockchain-based systems could be developed to reduce the need for banks to maintain their own databases of transactions, customer information and other reference data, and simplify the processes of reconciliation and confirmation of data with counterparties and clients, which is complex, costly, and labour-intensive. Blockchain technologies could enable investment banks to move from maintaining a separate, fragmented database structure to a shared, distributed database that spans organizations. The report identified the following areas where DLT could reduce costs for investment banks:

finance-reporting costs could shrink by 70 per cent as a result of the optimised data quality, transparency and internal controls provided with a shared, single source of verified data;
compliance costs could drop by 30-50 per cent at the product level and on a centralised basis due to the improved transparency and auditability of transactions;
centralised operations supporting functions such as KYC and client-onboarding could bring 50 per cent savings by establishing processes that are more efficient at managing digital identities and by “mutualising” – or sharing – a single source of client data securely across multiple banks; and
business operations such as trade support, middle office, clearance, settlement and investigations could also lower their operating costs by 50 per cent by reducing or eliminating the need for reconciliation, confirmation and trade-break analysis"

A report from McKinsey last week also underlined how blockchain technologies are set to impact banking and insurance. It found that “most people in the industry already believe that blockchain technology will “have a material impact” within three to five years”.
The study suggested that:

20-30 proof-of-concept use cases for blockchain technology could be tested in 2018 and 10-20 successful business cases could survive and be deployed commercially by late 2020;
in a survey of 200 companies, McKinsey found 64 different use cases for blockchain;
cross-border B2B payments are the biggest use case for blockchain, which McKinsey said could generate saving for banks valued at $50-$60 billion;
trade finance use cases could lower costs and speed up turnarounds to boost value by $14-$17 billion;

McKinsey also produced this list of 10 things you should know about blockchain:

European banks collaborate on trade
A recent example of DLT being applied in financial services is the announcement that seven banks plan to develop a blockchain platform that aims to make domestic and cross-border commerce easier for European small and medium-size (SME) businesses. The group – Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Société Générale and UniCredit – says the platform, called Digital Trade Chain (DTC), is ground-breaking. It is based on a prototype trade finance and supply chain solution originated and already tested by KBC. The DTC provides an online/mobile application that connects the buyer, seller, their banks and the transporter in a trade transaction, allowing them to manage and track international transactions.

CTMfile take: These studies by Accenture, McLagan and McKinsey show that blockchain-based platforms will bring very significant savings to the sectors of trade finance and cross-border payments services. The question is whether corporate customers will also benefit from these cost savings"

MMX 2012, the premier money-fund industry conference, is all about strategies to meet those challenges and survive and thrive while continuing to offer investors the safety and liquidity they require.

Twelve months on, the position in Europe is basically the same as it was in the US in March 2011. The money market funds exhibiting at the Association of Corporate Treasurers Annual conference in Liverpool in April were unanimous in what is happening:

money market funds products are pretty boring as all isseuers are waiting for new legislation and what they will have to comply with after the European Commission rules on the “shadow banking” system
corporate treasurers are staying very liquid, and looking for security and diversification for their cash, and at the same time better yield
terms have shortened, often to next week and maximum six months
search for better yields is intensifying, but as one fund manager put it: will corporates accept the greater risk? are they prepared to accept funds that include BBB paper as that is all that is available?

Would you buy a money market fund that includes BBB commercial paper? Maybe AAA funds are going to be a thing of the past?"

8026,3462,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/report-export-credit-financing-dropped-globally-in-2020,Report: export credit financing dropped globally in 2020,2021-07-12,,"The Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) has released its 2020 Report to the US Congress on Global Export Credit Competition (Competitiveness Report), which covers the 2020 calendar year.
Fall in export financing 
Total volumes of official medium and long-term (MLT) export credit support were down across the globe in 2020, including those provided by the world’s largest export credit provider, China. The COVID-19 pandemic was a prime contributor to both the noticeable drop in MLT activity by global export credit agencies (ECAs) and the significant use of short-term support and increase in working capital support to domestic industries.
In 2020, the top five countries providing official MLT export credit were China (US$18bn), France (US$12.1bn), Germany (US$8.6bn), Italy (US$8.4bn), and Korea (US$5bn). In support of US exports, EXIM authorised US$1.8bn in official MLT export credit financing.
""EXIM is on the pathway back to being a leader in export credit and providing the nature and scale of official MLT export credit needed to give US exporters and US interests a fair shot at trade opportunities in the years ahead,"" commented James C. Cruse, acting vice president and vice chairman of EXIM. ""During a global pandemic, EXIM showed resilience and agility in responding to U.S. exporters and enacting key reforms.""
Cruse noted that in 2020, EXIM implemented several reforms from the 2019 congressional reauthorisation package, including expanding support for and engagement with small businesses, renewable-energy projects, and minority- and women-owned businesses. He also noted that the report demonstrates that the US must work to keep pace with other official export credit providers who have fundamentally evolved their philosophies to focus on whole-of-government approaches to export financing. 
""This reality will require continued progress on all of EXIM’s strategic priorities and a fresh look at how the steps taken in 2020 can inform the agency’s actions in the future, including examining domestic financing opportunities in support of greater U.S. exports,"" Cruse added"

""This reality will require continued progress on all of EXIM’s strategic priorities and a fresh look at how the steps taken in 2020 can inform the agency’s actions in the future, including examining domestic financing opportunities in support of greater U.S. exports,"" Cruse added.
Further findings from the EXIM report:
China’s volume of official MLT export credit financing is down but still dominant
In 2020, estimates suggest that China’s official MLT export credit support appeared to decrease from just over US$33bn in 2019 to US$18bn in 2020, but its volumes remain significantly higher than all other major providers.
OECD and non-OECD activity
The MLT export credit volumes of the ECAs of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and major non-OECD ECAs (such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, known as the BRICS) were down. BRICs official MLT export credit activity decreased by approximately 50% while OECD ECA official MLT export credit activity decreased by only about 20%. Conversely, trade-related (unregulated) support offered by OECD and non-OECD countries increased, reducing the proportion of OECD Arrangement (regulated) activity to roughly 30% of total export and trade-related financing in 2020.
Global COVID-19 impact and expanded ECA roles
The COVID-19 crisis led many governments to call on their ECAs to serve as a tool to help boost economic growth while their economies struggled, for example, by directing ECAs to take steps meant to support broader export promotion in 2020 and expand programmatic offerings beyond traditional export credit support.
Emergence of sustainable finance
An emerging trend and driver in 2020 is the emergence of sustainable finance as a focus of ECA support. As governments around the world strengthen efforts to fight climate change and support companies driving innovation within the global energy transition, many ECAs made efforts to prepare for greener portfolios and to restrict new commitments for carbon-intensive projects"

As governments around the world strengthen efforts to fight climate change and support companies driving innovation within the global energy transition, many ECAs made efforts to prepare for greener portfolios and to restrict new commitments for carbon-intensive projects.
Importance of a whole-of-government approach
The US export community is placing increasing importance on ECAs and other government agencies working together as part of a whole-of-government approach for individual projects in emerging and developing markets in order to unlock official financing packages involving multiple government agencies and to create more competitive offerings.
Methodology
EXIM’s Competitiveness Report aggregates input from US exporters and lenders as well as EXIM’s counterparts from other countries and comprehensively analyses official export credit and trade-related finance provided last year by governments around the world. The report includes a worldwide survey of official medium- and long-term (MLT) export credit provided between 1 January and 31 December 2020, and an account of US exporter and lender experiences with EXIM during that period. The report meets the agency’s statutory requirement to report on how well EXIM was able to provide financing that is competitive with other major foreign government providers of export credit and enable US companies to be competitive in global export sales"

Are all the new requirements under all circumstances proportionate to the risks they were meant to address? What impact are the rules having on lending to smaller businesses, and to infrastructure projects? Could some of the rules be simplified or differentiated by risk or size, without compromising on their objectives of financial soundness and stability of banks?While the questionnaire seeks to focus on SMEs and infrastructure projects in particular, this is a chance for corporate treasurers to make their voices heard on issues that affect companies of all sizes. The areas that directly affect corporate treasurers include: bank credit lines to corporates, cash liquidity, bank fees, interest rates for deposits and bank-corporate relationships.Interested parties should provide their feedback in an online questionnaire. The EC will then report back on the feedback it receives at a public hearing later in 2015. The Commission's final report is due in 2016.Jonathan Hill, the EU's Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, is currently promoting the EU's €315 billion Investment Plan (IP/14/2128). The timely launch of this consultation on banking regulation is part of the EU's strategy for stimulating the economy. Hill says: ""Bank funding is and will remain central to our economy; whether it is lending to small businesses, or long-term investment in infrastructure. The Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive have restored resilience, stability, and trust in the European banking sector. These are vitally important objectives which the legislation has helped to achieve—but it is right to ask whether the rules have unintended consequences. This is part of our commitment to Better Regulation, and helps us strike the best possible balance between managing risk and enabling growth."""

So no wonder that Visa and MasterCard + the other card schemes via EMVco* are developing new intelligent tools to distinguish between good and bad transactions, all while minimizing disruption to consumers at checkout, and overcome some of the concerns with the existing authentication procedures.
3-D Secure 1.0 Protocol concerns
The EMV Specifications are based on contact chip, contactless chip, common payment application (CPA), card personalisation, and tokenisation. 3D Secure 1.0 was designed to secure the merchant, the card issuer and the financial transaction. It was later adopted by MasterCard, JCB International, and American Express into the own branded services. But there were and are concerns about the Version 1.0. NUDataSecurity web-site reports that:

“many merchants snub the service, feeling that the loss in conversion rates too great a price for only slightly less fraud. Merchants also pay monthly and transaction fees and 3D Secure can’t be integrated into the website for a seamless experience
3D Secure requires users to create additional logins with tough to remember passwords in a suspicious pop-up window that savvy Internet surfers avoid out of safe browsing habits. Customers either begrudgingly setup new passwords or abandoned the purchase. 
most countries show conversion rates on websites that use 3D Secure decreased by just under 10% to more than 50%, particularly high in the United States, China and Brazil
security experts argue that the system is still vulnerable by being next to impossible for users to distinguish between a legitimate 3D Secure pop-up from a phishing scam, and attempts to address the issue have only worsened.”

3-D Secure 2.0 Protocol concerns
The new specification, referred to as 3-D Secure 2.0, includes updates and enhancements to address the need for a more seamless online payment experience for consumers, while accommodating new devices and ways to pay. According to Visa they are planning to move to activate 2.0 in Europe in April 2018. The program activation dates for other markets will be announced separately.
V2.0 sounds as if it will improve e-commerce authentication, BUT it all depends on how it will be implemented"

V2.0 sounds as if it will improve e-commerce authentication, BUT it all depends on how it will be implemented. The NUDataSecurity web-site points out that 1.0 will continue to run in parallel with 2.0. NU DataSecurity would also like to see the following items addressed:

“Invisible and tightly integrated – no pop-ups and no extra steps. Shopping card abandonment rates and lost conversions under 1.0 make this clear.
Intelligent use of rich card data – it should be used to assess actual risk, not be more information the user needs to manually validate at the time of transaction.
Focus on behavioral – measure the things that are really impossible to fake. Biometric is a good start, but behavioral-based authentication is better.”

*EMVCo is a six member organisation —American Express, Discover, JCB, MasterCard, UnionPay, and Visa—and is supported by dozens of banks, merchants, processors, vendors and other industry stakeholders who participate as EMVCo Associates

CTMfile take: Authentication at the point of sale needs to be as easy as possible whilst minimising fraud. The new 3-D Secure 2.0 Protocol will improve prevention, but it is clearly not the final solution. No fraud is a dream, merchants have to choose what level is acceptable, see"
8033,3466,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/brexit-possible-impact-on-uk-consumer-payments-on-psd-and-regulatory-author,"Brexit: possible impact on UK consumer payments, on PSD and regulatory authorities",2016-06-27,,"Chris Jones, Director, PSE Consulting in his Blog on 24th June wrote:

Payment Service Directives: “Will the PSD1 remain on the statute book, and the PSD2 implemented as planned? The answer at this stage is probably. Many aspects of European legislation related to consumer protection are likely to remain because they did not fundamentally change existing UK rights. The UK government’s approach to account access is generally more progressive than that embodied in the PSD2, so this will probably be superseded by UK Open Data Initiative.”
Licensing and Passporting. “The FCA has established a good reputation with innovative European payments businesses for its regulatory regime. These eMoney and Payment Institutions will probably to move their headquarters to other European markets, and we will be poorer for it both commercially and from an innovations perspective. Changing the approach to passporting will affect the UK’s cross border acquirers the most. Many UK acquirers rely on passporting FCA regulatory licenses to support their local acquiring offers across the EU. Unless they already have licenses in other EU markets, acquirers will need to seek new EU regulatory approval to operate across the continent, and to sign new merchant contracts.”
Interchange regulation. “The UK CMA has always taken a close interest in the payments market, and many issuers expected interchange to decline in the medium term. It therefore seems unlikely that credit interchange will suddenly return to its previous levels. It may be that debit migrates back to the historical fixed price approach. This is particularly important within the context of the announced move to a basic 0.2% (removing the 50p cap and 1p fee) expected for Visa Debit in September.” 
European Banking Authority: “will almost certainly move, possibly to Paris to balance the ECB in Frankfurt.”
International card schemes: “Both have substantial presence in the UK, particularly Visa. It seems likely that Visa Inc. will increase its presence in Continental Europe as part of a wider restructure as other roles are migrated to the US. MasterCard may also to shift its emphasis to Waterloo away from Canary Wharf. Both schemes will need to adapt their licensing approaches, but these are already flexible enough to accommodate the inclusion of non-EU markets. Such moves by the card schemes may be to the detriment of London and the UK, but the impact will probably be modest"
8034,3466,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/brexit-possible-impact-on-uk-consumer-payments-on-psd-and-regulatory-author,"Brexit: possible impact on UK consumer payments, on PSD and regulatory authorities",2016-06-27,,"It seems likely that Visa Inc. will increase its presence in Continental Europe as part of a wider restructure as other roles are migrated to the US.

Such moves by the card schemes may be to the detriment of London and the UK, but the impact will probably be modest.
Impact on data processing and data security: @Remains unclear. Will the UK be treated as an off-shore location for card and payment processing? This will be a matter for the lawyers to resolve, but could affect Visa’s UK processing hub, or MasterCard’s rumoured purchase of VocaLink. New payments processors arriving in Europe from the US or Asia are also much less likely to locate their business in the UK.
Users of payments: Will consumer spend day to day be affected? Again, probably not. Consumers in the UK do not use SEPA Direct Debits or SEPA Credit Transfers domestically. They will continue their preference for cards in store, and online. The growth in online payments will continue, alongside the growth in contactless in-store. Similarly it seems unlikely that there will be a substantial change in the merchant landscape. 

Jones concludes:

“The UK will remain a vibrant market where retailers online and offline will fight for consumer spend. It seems less likely that our exit from the EU will impact this to any great degree.”
“There may be some potential downsides particularly in the area of acquiring and processing.”
“Any upsides? At this stage we struggle to see any, ……Perhaps benefits will emerge from the current maelstrom by 2017.”

The organisation announced that more than 20 market infrastructure providers (including payments associations, market practice groups, central banks and exchange groups) have endorsed the industry-driven ISO 20022 harmonisation charter project.
SWIFT's Patrik Neutjens, ISO 20022 programme director, said: “In the year since we launched the ISO 20022 harmonisation charter, the global support for the initiative has grown exponentially. We are very pleased with the great effort that has been put forward by the FMI community.”
Four principles for ISO 20022
SWIFT’s ISO 20022 harmonisation charter is based on four best-practice principles, which FMIs can implement into their own ISO 20022 initiatives. The principles are:

share information between FMIs about ISO 20022 usage;
adhere to global market practice where it exists and contribute to new global market practice initiatives;
introduce stricter message version control and release management process and timing, in line with the recently defined processes;
publish up-to-date information about standards on a common platform, including market practice compliance, messages and versions used and message release timeline.

Support for ISO 20022
The ISO 20022 harmonisation charter has gained support from:

the Payments Market Practice Group (PMPG),
the Securities Market Practice Group (SMPG),
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and
a number of European CSDs and central banks.

In this week's Spring Statement Philip Hammond said the government will be revising its ideas on fairer taxation of multinational digital businesses, in a move that could tackle profit shifting. But will it? In recent years, the amount contributed to state coffers by corporation tax has fallen, at a time when the country is seeing spending cuts to hospitals and schools and a rise in child poverty.
UK's corporate tax gap
The UK's corporation tax is the lowest of any G7 country (at 19 per cent, down from 30 per cent in 2005) and one of the lowest rates among the OECD nations. The current government plans to reduce it further to 17 per cent before the next general election.
A report from the IPPR, a progressive policy think tank, shows that the 11 per cent cut in corporation tax has reduced revenues for the state from 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2006 to 2.6 per cent of GDP today. It also estimates that the corporate tax gap is worth from £3 to £12 billion per year.
At the same time, there has been an increase in employers’ national insurance contributions, putting a larger burden on companies that employ more staff and placing them at a disadvantage compared to high-profit companies that employ fewer people.
Tackle profit-shifting
In its report Fair dues: Rebalancing business taxation in the UK, the IPPR recommends an increase in the rate of corporation tax from 19 to 24 per cent, in order to fund a reduction in employers’ National Insurance contributions by 2 per cent from 13.8 to 11.8 per cent. The report's author, Grace Blakely, writes: “This would have the effect of benefiting high-employment businesses – allowing for an increase in wages – while placing a higher burden on profitable companies which can afford to pay. It would also ensure that the burden of taxation fell more fairly on shareholders rather than employees.”
The report also proposes an ‘alternative minimum corporation tax’ that links the amount of tax a company pays to its economic activity in the UK, in order to tackle multinational tax avoidance and shifting profits to lower-tax jurisdictions.

Technology is set to change the way companies think about risks and here are six risk management trends to watch out for next year.
Risk as a 'performance driver'
Deloitte Advisory has published a report on the Future of Risk, which compiles a list of 10 trends in the realm of risk management worth watching out for in the coming year. The report's authors make the distinction between the risks that could damage our organisations and others that could actually turn out to have a positive impact on business. Some types of change can be “performance-drivers and value-creators worth embracing”, they argue.
The risks to watch out for may be of relevance to corporate treasury in various ways – from how we use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analytics, to carry out certain tasks more effectively, to a rethink on how we approach insurance contracts to protect our business. Some developments – such as the Internet of Things – will change the way we monitor and view security in our supply chains, while developments in our understanding of behavioural science could change how we monitor human behaviour in the workplace and our ability to detect risky behaviour.
These are some of Deloitte's 'risk trends' that will resonate with corporate treasury:

Artificial intelligence and data analytics are helping companies to detect, predict, manage and prevent risks.
The Internet of Things will change risk monitoring and the tracking of products across the supply chain to prevent fraud.
Behavioural science can be used in the workplace to detect risky behaviour and cognitive biases while also strengthening protocols.
Using vigilance and resilience in risk management instead of prevention – some risk prevention methods can yield unwelcome side effects such as slowing innovation, while using a vigilant or resilience approach may enable the company to detect and predict a risk event or even to react to it more effectively if it occurs.
Some events such as cyberattacks, political unrest and climate change have more widespread impacts, driving companies to re-examine insurance and contracts as business hedges.
Reputational risks have a greater impact in the age of social media, so companies need a more risk-intelligent strategy and monitoring systems that can allow them to cope with such events"

A study of 3,000 UK companies found they have as much as £136 billion in cash tied up on their balance sheets. The study on working capital looked at a sample of more than 3,000 large UK corporates and found that almost half (48 per cent) have seen their working capital efficiency deteriorate in the past year. But overall the companies, all of which have revenues greater than £100 million, have seen working capital efficiency improve by 3 per cent year-on-year, according to Grant Thornton's UK Working Capital study.
Brexit impacts corporate cash
The study also found that companies have been able to improve their cash-to-cash cycle from 31.6 days to 30.5 days, which meant an additional £8.8bn of cash on the balance sheets of the 3,000 UK corporates in the study.
UK companies have had to operate in an uncertain environment since the UK referendum in 2016, with fluctuating FX rates and uncertainty over import duties and trade tariffs. According to Grant Thornton's Mark O’Sullivan, this environment has focused the need for companies to ensure efficient working capital cycles. He noted there is a five-year high in corporate debt positions in the UK (now at £1.16 trillion), suggesting that companies are taking on debt and using their cash reserves to invest in their future growth. O’Sullivan added: “It’s encouraging to see that companies are investing in growth at a time of such macroeconomic uncertainty. Once the dust has settled and we know in more tangible terms what Brexit will look like and what it means for the economy, those firms that are positioned for growth will undoubtedly be best placed to capitalise on opportunities"

Some of the study's key findings include:

11 per cent of companies have managed to achieve improvements in working capital for three years consecutively;
EBIT margin performance is five times higher for companies that achieve three years of consecutive improvements in working capital;
the level of cash on hand decreased for the first time in five years across UK companies to £254 billion;
£136 billion in cash tied up in working capital on the balance sheets of UK corporates;
large corporates are under-performing their small and medium-sized peers in year-on-year working capital and profitability trends;
there has been a 3 per cent improvement in the cash-to-cash cycle year-on-year and a 9 per cent increase in year-on-year balance sheet debt.

Five steps to optimise working capital performance
The study also included these tips on how to optimise working capital:

Make working capital a strategic priority, with the right level of focus and support from senior management.
Understand what good looks like for your organisation, with consideration of your sector, size and use of relevant benchmarks.
Embed simple processes and controls such as standard payment terms and exception processes, and proactive collection procedures to provide improvements in working capital, or at the very least, protection from deterioration.
Develop and embed operational level metrics and KPIs that allow regular tracking of working capital performance, that can be understood by those in the business who have the ability to influence performance day-to-day.
Push the boundaries of best practice, using enablers such as supply chain finance and automated, data focused solutions that support inventory management"

Yet, less than one-quarter (23%) of companies worldwide at risk from the loss of biodiversity are currently disclosing that risk in their corporate reporting, according to 'The Time has Come, KPMG International's Survey of Sustainability Reporting 2020'.
With Earth losing species at a rate 1,000 times greater than at any other time in recorded human history, according to research from Brown University in September 2014, and a World Economic Forum report from January finding that roughly US$44 trillion of economic value generation - more than half of global GDP - moderately or highly dependent on nature and its services, it is clear that the need for action is urgent.
“Businesses have a responsibility to play their part in helping address the crisis of biodiversity loss, and a first step in doing so is recognising that their supply chains are highly dependent on nature and ecosystem services,"" said Richard Threlfall, head of KPMG IMPACT - an initiative that brings together professionals from KPMG firms to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). ""It is critical for all businesses to disclose the risks that biodiversity loss poses to their companies, as well as the impact their companies have on ecosystems. Our survey suggests that most companies have a long way to go when it comes to providing a full picture of business risks from biodiversity loss.”
Scrutiny on corporate reporting
KPMG's global survey reviewed corporate reporting from 5,200 companies - the top 100 companies by revenue in each of 52 different countries and jurisdictions. While it is notable that 80% of the world’s largest companies now report on sustainability, biodiversity-related risk remains significantly under-reported by the global business community.
Less than one-third (23%) of at-risk companies currently disclose biodiversity-related risks. This is despite repeated warnings about destruction of ecosystems and potentially dire consequences for people and the economy, the survey revealed. Mining is the only industry sector, according to the survey, in which a slim majority (51%) of companies currently report biodiversity-related risks.

Latin American companies are the most likely to report biodiversity-related risk (31%) while North American companies are the least likely (13%). Furthermore, the survey found that the two UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on addressing the global biodiversity challenge (SDG 14: Life Below Water and SDG15: Life on Land) are the least prioritised of all the 17 SDGs by businesses worldwide.
“Even though corporate reporting of biodiversity-related risk is currently low, I am optimistic that rapid improvement is possible,"" commented Adrian King, co-author of the survey, a partner at KPMG Australia, and chair of KPMG's global Climate Change & Sustainability network. ""We have seen dramatic progress in the disclosure of climate-related risks by business since the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was launched in 2015 and I expect to see a similar trend with nature and biodiversity-related disclosures.”
Further key findings from the KPMG Survey of Sustainability Reporting 2020 include:

North America has the highest regional reporting rate - 90% of North American companies report on sustainability.
Around two-thirds (65%) of reporting companies worldwide now have targets in place to reduce their carbon emissions.
More than two-thirds (69%) of reporting companies now connect their business activities with the UN Sustainable development Goals (SDGs) in their corporate reporting, but few (14%) disclose how they contribute to the global problems the SDGs seek to solve.
The SDGs most often prioritised by businesses worldwide are SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 13 - Climate Action, and SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption & Production.

Nevertheless, much of the discussions at the meeting focused on a U.S. adoption of ISO 20022 was worth it, particularly the issues of “standards within a standard” and the financial business case concept, or lack thereof. AFP report that, “At this point, the financial business case for ISO 20022 in the U.S. is fairly weak. So instead, the focus is more strategic. This strategic focus is very important, especially considering that much of the developed world are using, or will use, the ISO 20022 standard.”However, AFP raised several strategic issues: can the U.S. afford to ignore it? In the long run, probably not.  can corporations be enticed to voluntarily make this kind of switch (in the current environment) to their payments processes only based on a general strategic basis?  SEPA adoption of ISO 20022 only happened when it was mandated, and mandating such a change in the U.S. will not happen.AFP report that the conclusion was that, “Therefore, to further advance ISO 20022 in the U.S., additional education will be necessary. The ISO 20022 Stakeholders Group, consisting of the Federal Reserve, NACHA, The Clearing House and ASC X9, plans to embark on an extensive outreach program to educate businesses, while at the same time also learning from stakeholders what is important to them when considering a change of payments standards.”Managing commercial pressuresBut, and it is a big BUT, when a bank exits the cash management business and/or changes business direction it happens very quickly, e.g. RBS - see.

New payment systems patform
The WPR argues that a new conceptual model of collaborative banking platforms is emerging which will could look something like this (although they do accept that this only one of many possible scenarios):

The value proposition
This increased collaboration and partnership activity of the new permanent systems ecosystem will create business value for all stakeholders:corporates and consumers, banks and fintechs:

Open APIs are the new ecosystem enablers.
The WPR describes progress of open APIs - see figure below - and that, “Although to date APIs have been more commonly deployed in the retail payments market, open APIs can become a standardisation tool for corporate treasurers, enabling them to seamlessly integrate systems such as business intelligence, ERP, banking applications, and accounting across the cash and treasury management function. The implementation of open APIs also provides quick and flexible can play options for corporate treasurers to easily integrate any new product or service.”

Risk.net talked to spokesman for ESMA says it will not: ""The 90-day delay envisaged in the implementing of technical standards was only applicable to trades that were outstanding on August 16, 2012 and are still outstanding on the reporting start date. There is no delay foreseen in the regulations for trades that were executed after August 16, 2012 and are still outstanding on February 12, 2014."" So there are three possible scenarios with regard to backloading, whereby only two are clearly regulated.EMIRate newsletter also reports that: For corporates that also report their own trades with external counter-parties, this means that they will have to have received UTIs for these transactions from the counter-parties by no later than 11.2.2014. No ‘agreed UTI’ will be needed for trades, which expire or are closed out before 12.2.2014, with an internal trade reference code being sufficient.

Project Dunbar, led by the BIS Innovation Hub’s Singapore Centre, reported that financial institutions can trade directly with each other on a common platform using the CBDC issued by participating central banks and may help solve complex cross-border payment issues. BNM commented that the combined platform may reduce reliance on intermediaries and, as a result, reduce the cost and time required to settle cross-border transactions. Andrew McCormack, head of the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Singapore, stated that a common platform is the most efficient model for payment connectivity, but the most difficult to achieve. McCormack further added that Project Dunbar established the foundation for the development of future global and regional platforms, demonstrating that key concerns of trust and shared control can be addressed through governance mechanisms implemented by powerful technical means. BNM concurred that the project findings should be subject to governance deemed appropriate by central bank participants, including the ability to maintain control over the application of jurisdiction and currency-level rules.

The issuance of a CBDC carries significant risks, including the potential for the local currency to eventually lose its fundamental usefulness, according to a new report from the AMF's Arab Regional FinTech Working Group. The report mentioned some of the risks associated with local CBDCs: “digital dollarization” risk, international spillover, and impact on the international role of currencies. If the CBDC is successfully deployed outside its jurisdiction, the local currency may lose its function as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and storage of value, ultimately increasing the risk of financial instability, according to the report. Additionally, issuing CBDCs to non-residents could lead to increased exchange rate volatility and changes in cash flow dynamics as CBDC's have become attractive to investors as an alternative financial instrument. The AMF stated a list of CBDC alternatives that can offer benefits similar to those of CBDCs but are less risky. Among them are the international SWIFT payment system, the banking app Revolut, London-based fintech company Wise, and Ripple Labs' real-time gross settlement system RippleNet. Most of these non-CBDC alternatives have substantial restrictions or drawbacks noted in previous reports. Consequently, many central banks continue to conduct CBDC proof-of-concept or pilot projects"

Zelle, a US-based digital peer-to-peer (P2P) payment network used by many financial institutions to enable customers to send cash to friends and family rapidly, has shown a clear uptick pattern of fraud according to recent reports. Many banks have stated that once a customer approves the transfer of funds from their account, not much can be done. One fraud example, described in the NYT, showed a stolen mobile phone and misuse of the digital wallet, charging the credit card and withdrawing cash from an ATM. Affected accounts were all refunded except for the Zelle transfers. Consumers continuously look for solutions to prevent theft via these financial apps. According to Krebs security report, Zelle introduced out-of-band authentication with transaction details to combat such fraudulent tactics. An SMS is sent to the member containing the details of the initiated Zelle transaction. As a safeguard, members must reply to the text to approve the transaction. As payment apps like Zelle continue to rise in popularity, there are increasing issues and vulnerabilities, as hacking into these types of apps have also become easier for cybercriminals. Jesse Franklin, SVP US & Canada Incode, Digital Journal, recommends steps financial institutions can take to protect their customers from fraudulent transactions. Franklin proposes measures that include the implementation of biometric technology across multiple points of interaction, including both senders and recipients of funds. Additionally, Franklin states that digital technology should serve as the key to compliance and essentially detect recurring malicious individuals and prevent attempts to fraudulently confiscate funds from consumer accounts"

The bank ranked number 2 for FX globally in 2019, according to Euromoney. The initiative will make the city-state of Singapore Deutsche Bank’s fourth global FX centre, along with New York, London and Tokyo.
The Singapore e-FX hub will provide clients with the ability to execute FX transactions more closely aligned with geographic location, reducing latency, improving on local price transparency and liquidity.
""Given the substantial increase in demand for Asia currency e-FX we have seen in the past five years, growing client sophistication in e-FX trading, and the MAS’ focus on further developing the leading FX centre in the region, hubbing this activity in Singapore makes perfect sense,” said David Lynne, head of Fixed Income and Currencies APAC, head of Corporate Bank APAC and chief country officer, Singapore at Deutsche Bank.
The Deutsche Bank e-FX hub will be developed and staffed locally, and will be aligned to the bank’s focus across e-trading, fintech clients and digital FX payments.
“We are heartened by Deutsche Bank’s commitment to build its fourth global FX electronic pricing and trading engine in Singapore, which will complement its APAC fixed income and currencies and global transaction businesses operating here,"" said Gillian Tan, executive director, Financial Markets Development at MAS. ""This will allow Deutsche Bank to build on its strengths as a key global FX player and support its regional clients with enhanced price discovery and execution from Singapore, while leveraging Singapore’s strengths as Asia’s pre-eminent FX centre.”
As global cross border payment processes rapidly move towards being completely digital, Deutsche Bank will further develop its Singapore infrastructure to be the payments hub for transactional FX business in APAC. This will enable the bank to offer faster, automated FX and payment processes across the high growth but complex Asia markets, creating a centre of excellence to drive digital real time treasury and open banking from Singapore into payment corridors across the region and globally.
With Singapore the Fixed Income and Currencies centre for Deutsche Bank in Asia Pacific, the new e-FX hub forms part of the bank’s continued investment and development into digital and electronic platform client solutions"

Singapore also attracts BNY Mellon 
Just last week, BNY Mellon also announced it would be expanding its FX footprint in Singapore with the launch of an FX pricing and trading engine, in partnership with MAS.
The bank will establish a low-latency electronic FX infrastructure in the Southeast Asian nation, helping to improve execution quality and price discovery for clients initially in spot, and subsequently in deliverable and non-deliverable forwards and swaps.
“We’ve spent the past four years fully integrating and accentuating our global FX capabilities, and this is just the next step in the bank’s commitment to the region, specifically to Singapore as the hub of our Asia G10 FX trading,” said Darren Boulos, head of FX Sales and Trading in Asia-Pacific at BNY Mellon. “With the benefit of local support, we can accelerate our offering of additive liquidity to clients.”
BNY Mellon already sees significant FX volumes in Singapore across more than 70 deliverable currencies, including in most restricted APAC markets, thanks to the uncorrelated liquidity that comes with executing daily flows for clients of its large custody franchise. In 2019, the bank set up a dedicated FX custody trading desk in Singapore, relocated its Short-Term Interest Rate Trading (STIRT) business from Hong Kong, and established a Singapore options trading desk.
MAS strategy paying off
Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon are the latest in a series of banks that are focussed on Singapore as an FX trading hub for Asia. Back in April, we reported on CTMfile that J.P.

Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon are the latest in a series of banks that are focussed on Singapore as an FX trading hub for Asia. Back in April, we reported on CTMfile that J.P. Morgan had established an electronic FX trading and pricing engine in Singapore. The partnership with MAS was described as being part of the central bank’s strategic initiative to develop Singapore into a global price discovery and liquidity centre for FX during Asia trading hours.
All of these announcements have one thing in common - the close partnership between the banks and MAS, which reflects the strategy of MAS to attract global banks to the country. 
In a fireside chat at ACI Live Aid: Financial Markets Give Back, on 29 May 2020, Ravi Menon, managing director of MAS spoke in depth about the country's approach to FX trading. He noted that FX and treasury has been one of the better performing segments in the financial industry, and that the Singapore FX market had been able to manage the volatility from the global impact of COVID-19.
FX trading volumes in March hit a record high because people were hedging, offloading, and readjusting their investment positions. Activity has now come down to a more normal level. Menon noted that spreads have widened, which is to be expected in times like these, but that they have not widened unduly and there is sufficient liquidity in the system.
In terms of the FX infrastructure that MAS has been putting in place to support swings in trading activities, Menon noted that MAS wanted pricing and matching engines to be based in Singapore, so that they would not have to wait for prices to be matched in London, New York, or Tokyo. He explained there is still a time lag taken to route orders to these markets. Sometimes there are execution errors with these lags, particularly during periods of trading volatility.
Menon also commented that Singapore has had success in attracting key liquidity providers and platforms to base their pricing and matching engines in the country. In addition to the aforementioned BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, and J.P. Morgan, the country hosts similar FX engines of Citibank, Standard Chartered Bank, UBS, BNP Paribas, XTX, and Jump Trading.
The MAS strategy is clearly paying off, making Singapore an FX leader not just in Asia, but at the top table globally"
8060,3481,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/making-kyc-checks-easier-for-corporates,Making KYC checks easier for corporates,2021-04-16,,"For corporate treasurers around the world, the need to repeatedly provide banks with information for mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) checks continues to be a huge cause of frustration and inefficiency. Corporates often have multiple banking partners across numerous jurisdictions, each with their own unique KYC process for onboarding new customers.
According to research in a recent Eurofinance whitepaper, this lack of standardisation when it comes to compliance checks is a significant deterrent for corporates, with over 50% reporting that they would reduce the number of banks they work with just to avoid lengthy KYC processes.
SWIFT’s KYC Registry
Initially created for the banking community in an effort to streamline the global payments compliance process, SWIFT’s KYC Registry was designed with a simple idea at its core - eliminate the need to repeatedly provide KYC data every time a new customer is onboarded or recertified. Instead, users are able to upload the majority of their KYC information to the registry, and can then grant other banks access to complete a check.
Today, more than 6,000 banks around the world benefit from using the KYC Registry. One year ago, to also help corporates overcome the challenges associated with KYC checks, SIWFT opened the registry’s doors to those corporates on its network. 
""The banking community has embraced the registry and we’re really pleased with the response from our corporate customers too,"" says Delphine Masquelier, product manager in KYC Compliance Services at SWIFT. ""It’s been fantastic to watch it grow and even exceed our expectations. We’ve been working with 15 banks to determine corporate requirements and ensure they can easily use the registry, and are proud to say that over 50 banking groups are now using it with their corporate customers."" 
At the moment, around 80% of the required information for KYC checks can be stored on the registry, meaning that onboarded corporates no longer have to repeatedly upload the same documents for each of their banking partners. Instead, after uploading their KYC information, all that’s left to do is make sure it’s kept up to date, leaving more time to drive value in other business areas.
""Banks, like corporates, have to respond to KYC requests for data and documents on our legal entities,"" says Mark Trivedi, MD of Client Experience Operations Transformations at J"

""Banks, like corporates, have to respond to KYC requests for data and documents on our legal entities,"" says Mark Trivedi, MD of Client Experience Operations Transformations at J.P. Morgan. ""Using SWIFT’s KYC Registry for the bulk of this content has allowed our internal teams to focus on the residual portions of requests and other activities. As corporates leverage the registry, they can leverage the platform’s potential to increase their own teams’ efficiency too.""
Digital solutions in the age of the pandemic
While the compliance industry was already shifting towards digital solutions, the coronavirus pandemic has reinforced the value of tools like SWIFT’s KYC Registry. Businesses and financial institutions are constantly having to adapt their operations and offerings as the pandemic unfolds, but tools that leverage digitisation, like the registry, have the potential to make life significantly easier for compliance professionals - alleviating some of the burden of KYC checks. 
""The pandemic has caused us to reassess the way we work in a lot of different areas,"" says Andre Duesterhus, head of Regulatory Client Management Germany at Deutsche Bank. ""But fortunately using the registry within correspondent banking and with our corporate customers means that performing these compliance checks has remained a simple process for us. While some corporate treasurers are already using SWIFT’s KYC Registry, others have had to navigate new compliance workflows without realising they can benefit from it in the same way.""
A future proof solution
Fulfilling compliance checks is an essential part of maintaining the integrity of the global financial system, but there’s no doubt completing them can be time-consuming. SWIFT's dedicated registry onboarding team aims to make the move towards digital KYC processes easy for any corporate customer on the SWIFT network. The cooperative says it is committed to helping corporates and banks work as efficiently as possible by providing solutions like this.
""This really is a solution that lets us take care of the heavy lifting corporates are usually required to do themselves in the KYC process,"" concludes Masquelier"

""For example, when we onboard a new corporate customer, our team is able to populate the majority of the mandatory fields using the information they provide - saving them time from the very beginning. Understandably, some corporates have been reluctant to adopt new compliance solutions for fear that they won’t stand the test of time. That’s not the case with our KYC Registry, which is backed by the SWIFT community and will continue to evolve to make compliance checks more efficient. As a corporate, you can have peace of mind that signing up to the registry today will continue to benefit you in the future.""
There are currently more than 50 banking groups using SWIFT’s KYC Registry with their corporate customers to streamline their compliance processes, including Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, HSBC, Intesa San Paolo, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, Societe Generale and UniCredit - all of which are actively working towards the success of the initiative"

Just 28 per cent of financial service organisations (FSOs) have unified cross-channel authentication management. And fewer than half – 49 per cent – have partial cross-channel coverage. This is according to a study by Nice Actimize and PwC, which examined the state of omni-channel authentication strategies in the financial services industry. It found that only 28 per cent of FSOs have fully implemented cross-channel authentication management and that a lack of a unified strategy to manage authentication methods across channels resulted in a “poor customer authentication experience and less effective fraud reduction strategies”.
The report – Omni-Channel Authentication: A Unified Approach to a Multi-Authenticator World – noted that smaller organisations might offer fewer authentication products and operate across fewer channels so they are able to achieve unified cross-channel authentication management before larger companies. And surprisingly, 13 per cent of those surveyed have not yet assessed their authentication strategy – see the graph below.

The survey found that:

63 per cent of respondents from FSOs are assessing current authentication strategies to identify where there may be gaps or requirements for further investments in omni-channel authentication – but only 30 per cent of the surveyed organizations have completed that assessment to date;
61 percent will invest in an omni-channel authentication solution within the next 12-18 months;
28 per cent have the ability to manage all authenticators across all channels today;
83 percent of fraud management teams singled out a frictionless customer authentication experience as a key central driver behind their efforts; and
58 per cent will integrate fraud and risk data into omni-channel authentication orchestration decisioning.

PwC's Vikas Agarwal said: “In an age of authentication innovation, consumers want preferences in authentication type. But with many disparate authenticators in play, users face inconsistent experiences in each channel and lengthy and excessive challenges.”
And Nice Actimize's Joe Friscia suggested that sophisticated analytics that can make real-time challenge decisions will be an important method of reducing friction for consumers while keeping them safe from fraudsters.

Generally, banking involves reviewing a vast amount of data collected from various customers and transactions recorded in the banking system. External sources such as mobile service providers, social networks and credit bureaus add to the abundant existing data. To fully realize the potential of bank data, the entire data lifecycle needs to be properly managed and administered from data collection, recording and monitoring to visualization, analysis and interpretation. Data sets can significantly improve a bank's profitability and sustainability if managed effectively.
Financial organizations can use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to effectively make intelligent business decisions and translate them into the “data intelligence” they need to remain competitive and profitable. According to Edler Panlilio, Managing Director, SAP Philippines, three important aspects to help banks obtain an efficient data strategy and obtain the most out of this data are:

Data management with data ownership. This includes data collection, storage, structuring, auditing, cleaning and monitoring.
Reporting and visualization. This includes creating intelligent views of bank performance, portfolio quality, employee productivity and other categories needed to drive the business.
Data analysis, the most challenging but most valuable part of a data strategy. Analytical models developed by banks enable banks to anticipate customer behaviour, better understand their needs and preferences, and proactively manage the entire business.

Union Bank of the Philippines (Union Bank), one of the first banks in the Philippines to embrace technological innovations, utilizes data intelligence as part of its data strategy to further accelerate its digital initiative by working with SAP to create a new banking model that supports customer-centric services. Union Bank, with the help of SAP Data Intelligence, integrated the first known ""Data Science Factory"" model into their systems in Southeast Asia’s (SEA) financial sector. Additionally, this model will help banks achieve improved business management, improve internal processes, and gain a better end-to-end perspective on all operations. Union Bank's implementation of SAP’s comprehensive Data Intelligence solution for its new digital framework has transformed the bank’s distributed data sets into important data insights for superior innovation. 
According to SAP, banks using this solution can effortlessly retrieve the most relevant data through enhanced metadata tags, user-generated ratings and comments, and an integrated business glossary. In addition, banks can connect data silos to build enterprise data structures that increase visibility across multiple data assets"

SAP Data Intelligence serves as Union Bank’s governance and internal control processes. Additionally, it helps Union Bank streamline operations and manage regulatory compliance and risk management parameters in its new digital framework. Data Intelligence also enables financial institution’s administrators and internal staff with important information and tools to deliver exceptional customer service. For example, using the Data Science Factory model, all the data and insights collected by Union Bank will help leverage AI and help customers better understand their financial capabilities. In addition, banks can protect the privacy of customers while facilitating responsibilities such as loans, savings and other services.
As banks typically process large numbers of documents on a daily basis, Union Bank recognized the need to improve efficiency and internal communications. To address this challenge, banks are currently using SAP Signature Management by DocuSign to automate workflows from simple contracts to the most complex transactions such as loan applications. According to DocuSign, users can easily send, review and sign documents anytime, anywhere using network support for iOS, Android and Windows Mobile.
Organizations from all industries, including banks and financial institutions, are embracing proactive initiatives and innovative solutions to retain their customers. With intelligent banking becoming one of the most important trends in the industry today, banks and financial institutions in the Philippines look to adopt AI-enabled technology for digital transformation. In addition to customer retention, banks also contribute to the expansion of financial inclusion and provide better banking experiences"

The DEA ensures that financial institutions operating in Singapore and Australia are able to transfer information that they generate or hold more seamlessly across borders. The conclusion of negotiations for the DEA was jointly announced by the Prime Ministers of Singapore and Australia.
Under the DEA, Singapore and Australia have also committed to prohibit requirements for data localisation, which the countries say are an unnecessary barrier to trade and can drive up the cost of storing data for all businesses. Both countries will allow financial institutions to choose where their data is stored.
The Australian government’s Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade website says that the DEA sets new global benchmarks for trade rules, and a range of practical cooperation initiatives, to reduce barriers to digital trade and build an environment in which Australian businesses and consumers are able to participate and benefit from digital trade and the digitalisation of the economy.
The DEA will upgrade the digital trade arrangements between Australia and Singapore under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. It delivers more robust rules that ensure businesses, including in the financial sector, can transfer data across borders and will not be required to build or use data storage centres in either jurisdiction; improves protections for source code; establishes new commitments on compatible e-invoicing and e-payment frameworks, and; delivers new benchmarks for improving safety and consumer experiences online.
The DEA also delivers a range of new trade rules, and a comprehensive framework for bilateral cooperation, to help businesses and consumers capitalise on the digital economy. Australia and Singapore have signed a series of memorandum of understanding (MoUs) on areas including data innovation, artificial intelligence, e‑invoicing, e-certification for agricultural exports and imports, trade facilitation, personal data protection, and digital identity.
Cooperation under the DEA will additionally include work to support the development of key standards to support digital trade. This work has already begun with a jointly commissioned study to identify priority opportunities for increased digital standardisation, reporting to Australia and Singapore in mid-2020.

Lost in Transaction found that half of the consumers it surveyed, in the UK, US, Canada, Germany and Austria, said fraud is the biggest barrier to using them and almost half also expressed concerns around the use of their data. A further two-thirds of consumers think voice-activated systems are not secure and a similar percentage also worry about being overcharged if they use this type of service. Many consumers – 56 per cent – also think checkout-free stores – where smart technologies record the shopping basket and automate payments – sound too risky, or they’d need to know more before using them.
Considering the level of mistrust in frictionless payment technologies, it's not surprising that the study found that cash continues to thrive as the most common form of payment, with 87 per cent of consumers using it in the past month to make a purchase. It also found that the majority – 83 per cent – of consumers visited ATMs in the last month, while 41 per cent of consumers are not interested in hearing about cash alternatives. This, says Paysafe, is a clear indication of the ongoing influence of cash.
Paysafe's Oscar Nieboer said: “Despite the apparent benefits of low-friction payment technologies, these findings suggest many consumers aren’t ready to lose visibility of the payment process. It’s clear that the benefits are not unilaterally agreed upon, with cultural and infrastructure trends at play, and it may be some time before adoption is widespread. In the meantime, there’s a need to continue servicing the cash consumer.”
Some of the other key takeaways from the report include:

The UK leads the world in contactless shopping, with 54% of consumers using it in the last month – compared to just 3% of US shoppers.
50% of survey respondents used a digital wallet such as Skrill or NETELLER for online purchases, more than either credit or debit cards. But in Austria and Germany, payment by invoice is more popular than card payments too, used by 38% of Austrians and 29% of Germans"

Just 9% of consumers use mobile wallets for shopping in-store, due to a lack of awareness and scepticism about security and convenience. But usage for payments is high among smartphone owners, at 44%.
Only 23% of consumers have used frictionless payments in apps such as Uber, despite widespread awareness. At the same time, only 18% of respondents use voice-activated payments systems.
43% of shoppers are comfortable using smart buttons to order often-used single items. But equal numbers would not do so, and only 33% would let fridges automatically re-order food.
Canadian and UK shoppers reported a rise in fraud in 2017, of 7% and 6% respectively.

The jump in confidence reflects both progress in the successful deployment of vaccines, a degree of clarity provided by the roadmap out of lockdown for England and plans to ease restrictions in other parts of the UK. 
Survey responses were captured between 1st March and 15th March 2021, with the latest increase in confidence being driven by gains in firms’ trading prospects and their optimism about the wider economy. The net balance of firms reporting stronger optimism about the economy increased by fifteen points to 17%. 
Firms’ trading prospects for the year ahead also climbed by ten points to 12%, with 34% (up five points) anticipating a pick-up in activity and 22% (down five points) preparing for less activity. Overall business confidence is calculated by averaging the views of 1,200 companies on their business prospects and optimism about the UK economy.
Of the businesses surveyed, there appears to be solid support for the speed at which lockdown restrictions are being eased. The majority of firms (57%) agree with the pace of reopening their sector, although there is a significant minority (34%) that prefer a quicker lifting of restrictions. However, 9% of firms said they would benefit from a slower pace.

However, the proportion anticipating pay rises of two percent or more fell marginally to 17% from 18%, and remains around the average level since the start of the pandemic.
Firms’ pricing intentions for the year ahead continue to rise. The net balance of firms expecting to raise prices for their goods and services increased three points to 31%, matching the level a year ago. Some 37% (up one point) of businesses plan to increase their prices, while 6% (down two points) intend to lower them. A quarter of the firms in manufacturing and a fifth in retail have paid higher costs than pre-pandemic levels to secure their supply chain. 
""It’s been a year since the first lockdown and the surge in confidence this month tells us firms are increasingly confident about economic recovery,"" commented Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. ""The broadly positive outlook is driven by steady vaccine deployment, the roadmap out of lockdown and the extension of government support measures. It will be interesting to see whether the momentum for stronger business optimism is sustained in the months ahead.""

Global demand for UK technology drives recovery
Meanwhile, the number of UK sectors reporting output growth doubled in February, led by a strong performance from technology equipment manufacturers, according to the latest Lloyds Bank UK Recovery Tracker. The Tracker, working with IHS Markit, provides insight into the shape and pace of the UK’s recovery from the disruption caused by COVID-19.
The output of six of the 14 UK sectors monitored by the Tracker rose in February, up from three in January, with technology equipment manufacturers (58.2) recording the strongest growth. A reading above 50 signals output is rising, while a reading below 50 indicates output is contracting.
Accounting for their robust performance, technology equipment manufacturers, which include producers of specialist parts in smart devices, motor vehicles, computers and industrial machinery, cited higher international demand for components. As a result, it was the only UK sector monitored by the Tracker to register a rise in new export orders during February"

Accounting for their robust performance, technology equipment manufacturers, which include producers of specialist parts in smart devices, motor vehicles, computers and industrial machinery, cited higher international demand for components. As a result, it was the only UK sector monitored by the Tracker to register a rise in new export orders during February.
Firms within the sector also cited new orders from global technology companies diversifying their supply chains and investing in research and development to improve resilience following COVID-19.
The output growth of food and drink manufacturers (53.7), the second-best performing sector during February, was driven by continuing strong demand from domestic retailers, while the healthcare (52.6) sector benefitted from demand for goods and services that support the UK’s COVID-19 vaccine programme.
Despite the increase in UK sectors registering output growth during February, the stringency of the UK’s lockdown restrictions in comparison to other major economies meant only the technology equipment and food and drink manufacturing sectors were ahead of their global counterparts during February, down from three sectors in January.
However, the gap between world (53.2) and UK PMI output indices (49.6) narrowed in February suggesting many UK firms have become more resilient to the impact of lockdown. 
Public impact of falling exports and supply chain disruption on manufacturers intensifies
The output of automotive (49.1), household products (46.8), metals and mining (45.5) and chemicals (45.4) manufacturers fell in February as businesses reported longer lead times due to record shortages of raw materials and shipping containers. Six of the seven manufacturing sectors monitored by the Tracker recorded a fall in new export orders during February. Chemicals, automotive and food and drink manufacturers all cited reluctance from overseas customers to place new orders amid post-Brexit trade frictions with the European Union.
Meanwhile, the proportion of manufacturers reporting shortages of raw materials, including timber, packaging and polymers, was the highest so far recorded by the Tracker. The number of firms affected by a lack of transport capacity was also nearly 10 times higher than in October 2020. February’s scarcity was linked to shipping container shortages and delays at UK ports"

This supply chain disruption fuelled the fastest rate of manufacturing sector input cost inflation since January 2017, when sterling exchange rate depreciation against the US dollar led to a spike in the price of imported materials to the UK.
""It is encouraging to see a rising number of UK sectors register output growth in February, despite the challenging lockdown conditions,"" said Jeavon Lolay, head of Economics and Market Insight at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking. ""It highlights both strong global demand and how well UK businesses and households have adapted to tough restrictions on mobility. It suggests that a modest rise in monthly UK GDP is possible in February, after the smaller-than-expected decline in January. However, February’s data also shows that the UK’s economic recovery from COVID-19 is tied to more than just the stringency of lockdown restrictions, which disproportionately affect consumer-facing services sectors. Manufacturers are facing into a more challenging export environment and the global supply chain disruption currently holding many firms back looks set to continue."""

According to Reuters, correspondent JP Morgan received the payment and issued credit to Citigroup, the payment agent responsible for distribution to investors. A Treasury spokesman told Bloomberg that US sanctions on transactions with the Russian central bank and other institutions will not prevent Moscow from making payments to Americans on dollar-denominated debt until midnight on May 25. However, Russia has previously stated that it will repay its external debt in rubles if it is not allowed to pay in dollars. Rating agency Fitch said investors are expected to be paid in dollars, which could lead to defaults if not in dollars. The $117 million interest payment on two-dollar bonds was a crucial test for a country whose credit ratings have recently been downgraded from investment grade to junk. According to economists, this week's reopening of the Russian stock market is unlikely to cause widespread turmoil. Russia closed its stock market for three weeks due to concerns over a large sale and potential economic downturn due to the impact of financial sanctions and the sharp fall in the ruble (RUB). Reports indicate the opening of the market is certain to bring some sell-offs over the week, as Russia remains separated from the West and continues to seek intervention after the United States, Europe and Japan deprived Russia of access to SWIFT's global economic system. The Moscow Times reported last Friday that Russia's central bank would buy government bonds when it resumes trading, but it did not say how much it would spend to ""limit the risks to financial stability."" Russian economist and current head of the Central Bank of Russia, Gov. Elvira Nabiullina, stated that they are ready to gradually resume trading on the Moscow Exchange, and trading will open for government bonds today. Additionally, she commented that “in order to neutralize excessive volatility and provide balanced liquidity, the Central Bank will buy government bonds."""

According to BTr, it will auction 35 billion pesos in 7-year government bonds (T-bonds) with a remaining period of 6 years and 4 months on Tuesday. Some bond traders speculate that T-bill yields could rise by 5 basis points (bps) this week, and 7-year T-bond rates could range from 5.35% to 5.55%. The US Federal Reserve's rate hike was as expected, but ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine also affects domestic inflation. Michael L. Ricafort, Chief Economist, Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said that T-bill yields could continue to rise this week as the secondary market surges weekly. Additionally, he said the US Fed's rate hike last week had already been priced by the market, along with Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up global oil and commodity prices. Last week, the US Fed raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point for the first time since 2018 to combat rising inflation, and six more increases are planned for the rest of 2022.

The US Treasury undersecretary, Nelly Liang, commented that current digital assets are not large enough to run the economy, and the ecosystem is underdeveloped for individuals to effectively avoid sanctions on such assets. Liang also stated that while illicit financing is growing due to the use of crypto, its share as a medium for illegal financing is not greater than the use of cash. Earlier this month, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen vowed to fill a loophole in the severe sanctions imposed on Russia after the February 24 invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, money laundering prevention laws have been enforced to prevent members of the Russian elite from using cryptocurrencies to circumvent these measures.

By definition, open finance aims to enable consumers to compare a wide range of financial products across the banking sector, such as insurance, annuities, merchant acquisition and non-bank loan providers. The Treasury commented that the implementation of open finance can inform consumers in deciding which services to use from these sectors, as many consumers currently make decisions based on ""rule of thumb"" or shortcuts such as selecting a recognised institution or an institution with which they have an existing banking contract. Furthermore, the Treasury identified home and car insurance to be the top priorities when adopting open finance, especially in the insurance sector. As with previous CDR extensions, the open finance implementation involves a formal evaluation and designation process. The Treasury, as part of the consultation process, wants to receive general opinion from non-bank lenders about which datasets need to be covered with CDRs to drive the creation of new and innovative services. According to the Treasury, information on energy products will be shared so that consumers can better compare their energy plans beginning in October 2022. Additionally, energy consumers will be able to provide consent to share their data about their own energy use and connect with a comparison service or fintech app commencing in November 2022"

It found that 38 per cent of banks were still in the early stages of assessing the impact the payments regulation would have, while only 9 per cent were in the implementation stage of the new PSD2 requirements.
PSD2 – which gives a regulatory framework for 'open banking' – means that EU-based banks will need to give authorised third-parties payment providers (TPPs) access to customer’s bank accounts. PwC states that “PSD2 is a testament to the newly unfolding world of open banking where (fin)tech companies, merchants and even telco’s can change the payments landscape completely.”
Banks' monopoly over
The key feature of open banking, underlined by PwC, is that, in January 2018, the “banks’ monopoly over customer account information and payment services will effectively cease”.
The survey, conducted in the first half of 2017, gathered responses from 39 bank executives in 18 European countries, covering most of the world’s leading banks. It also found that almost all banks (94 per cent) were currently working on PSD2 in some way or another and two out of three banks say they want to use PSD2 to change their strategic positioning.
Banks need strategic response to PSD2
Half of those interviewed said their bank aims to develop an open platform that allows partners to integrate their products and services into the bank’s offering, while providing an open platform for generating new products and services based on the bank’s API and data.
PwC's Marco Folcia noted that PSD2 will be a compliance challenge for banks in the run up to implementation. He added: “Banks need a proper strategic response to avoid becoming disintermediated by more customer-oriented third-party offerings. They will need to analyse the emerging payments landscape and identify new revenue opportunities for services, something most have yet to do.”"

This does not include the negative impact on customer and supplier relationships, and any impact on employees who have not been paid their wages/salaries.
The costs could be huge because it may well not be the occasional isolated payment that fails. Experian, the information services company, estimate that 12% or more of EUR denominated payments could contain incorrect data. One-third of the errors are caused by an indicated bank or branch code not being in use; either because the data was not updated after a branch closed or merged with another entity, or because incorrect data was supplied in the first place. Incorrect sets of data can stay in a company's system for years without anyone noticing.
Rejection rates are climbing, and in some clearing rejectioin rates are already 15%+.

Through this agreement, BNY Mellon will deliver real-time account validation services to clients, and offer the flexibility to tailor a solution to meet clients' individual needs - whether through BNY Mellon directly, or through one of its Private Label Bank relationships. The bank says that this collaboration marks another step in its strategy to provide digital payment services that support clients with all of their payment needs, both now and in the future.
""We are very pleased to work with Early Warning Services to bring this integrated solution to our clients,"" said Michael Bellacosa, global head of Payments and Transaction Services at BNY Mellon. ""Our goal is to support our clients' digital journeys in the payments space and to help them achieve greater operational efficiencies, manage risk and reduce cost.""
Through this solution, BNY Mellon says it will enable clients to validate the status and owner of accounts across the US in real-time to provide increased risk and fraud prevention capabilities prior to the execution of payments. It is also payment agnostic and can be used to verify the status of an account and ownership prior to sending a wire transfer, automated clearing house (ACH) or real-time payment. 
Account owner authentication
The service leverages EWS' Real-time Payment Chek Service with Account Owner Authentication, which quickly validates if the account is open and in good standing and that the payee is an owner or authorised signer on the account. This should help clients in their efforts to effectively manage risk associated with payment processing across a multitude of use-cases. This service enables clients to better manage the growing compliance requirements to pre-validate payment data prior to making payments or requesting funds.
""Early Warning Services has collaborated with BNY Mellon in bringing innovative payment solutions to the market in the past, assisting corporates and banks to adopt new digital services,"" said Lou Anne Alexander, chief product officer at Early Warning Services. ""The extension of this relationship addresses an increasingly important need for clients who are seeking real-time account validation to further reduce the risk of fraud and misdirected payments - which reduces costs and delivers a better user experience for clients"

BNY Mellon says it will offer clients multiple channels to access the solution based on their preference, including real-time application programming interface (API) integration, batch-file services and an online user interface. The API solution channel offers the added convenience of full integration with clients' existing treasury and vendor management systems to streamline customer enrollments and payment processing. This solution will be offered in conjunction with BNY Mellon's Real-Time Payments, Zelle® Disbursements and traditional cash management services in its Private Label portfolio.
Data and analytics focus
Last week, BNY Mellon also announced the launch of three data and analytics solutions that are designed to help investment managers better manage their data, improve the success of US-listed fund launches and support the customisation of investment portfolios to preferred environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. 
Additionally, as part of its digital strategy to collaborate with external partners, BNY Mellon has expanded its relationship with Microsoft to create data, technology and content solutions for investment managers built on Microsoft Azure. Three new offerings already launched include:

Data Vault: A cloud-based data and analytics platform that supports the rapid onboarding of data to provide greater flexibility and accelerate client innovation and discovery. Combining this with a scalable, machine learning approach to data quality, users can more quickly and easily interact with data to gain actionable insights.

By contrast the business value of AI in banking during 2018 is estimated at $41.1 billion, a figure that includes the cost savings and efficiencies of introducing AI technology against keeping existing infrastructures and processes.
The study suggests that AI is becoming more commercially viable in banking, for tasks from fraud detection to helping automate processes. The business information provider makes its prediction based on a widely projected increase in the number of AI projects reportedly under development
“The innovative capabilities AI will bring to financial services will be transformative,” says Don Tait, principal analyst at IHS Markit. “AI is poised to challenge and blur our concepts of computing and the ‘natural’ human.
“This sea change will require both businesses and governments to develop expansive foresight and critical understanding of the full effects of digitisation and emerging technologies.”
Apac to take top slot
According to the report, North America is projected to be the largest market for AI in banking between 2018 and 2023. AI in the region will increase from a business value of $14.7 billion in 2018 to nearly $79 billion by 2030. However, North America’s proportional importance of is expected to decline between 2024 and 2030 as Asia Pacific, Europe and other global regions roll out more AI solutions in the banking sector.
Asia Pacific is the second largest region employing AI in banking, increasing from a business value of $11.5 billion in 2018 and will become the leading region in 2024, with a business value of $50.6 billion. By 2030, the figure for the Apac region is expected to reach $98.6 billion.
“Countries like China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore are likely to drive the demand for AI within the banking sector over the next 10 years,” Tait says.

Do you know how your bank will handle PSD2?
As a new consultation on guidelines for compliance with PSD2 are issued, banks face a stark choice of accepting the new payments world passively – or proactively developing additional services to retain customers. Do you know how your bank will handle PSD2?
Consultation on guidelines for PSPs
Preparations for the implementation of the EU's revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) are continuing and the European Banking Authority (EBA) last week published a consultation on draft guidelines on how payment and e-money institutions should apply to gain authorisation and meet requirements under PSD2. This effectively also sets the minimum conditions that must be met to secure an authorisation and could be the basis of ongoing compliance under PSD2 in future – so it's of interest not just to aspiring payment service providers but also the current ones. It reminds us of the fact that things are about to change significantly for financial payment institutions when PSD2 becomes law by 13 January 2018.
Changes to come
A report by Accenture spells out some of the ways in which the UK's payments landscape will change from 2018.
PSD2 is threatening the relationship banks have with their customers because one of its core requirements is for banks to grant third party providers (TPPs) access to a customer’s online account/payment services in a regulated and secure way – known as ‘Access to Account’ (XS2A). XS2A enables application programme interfaces (APIs) to gain access to customer accounts and data (provided the account holder provides consent). Under the new PSD2 rules, Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) will be able to initiate third party payments initiation and Account Information Service Providers or (AISPs) will be able to have third party account access.
Banks could lose out on 'customer ownership'
The two graphics below, from the Accenture report, show how PISPs and AISPs will change existing interaction models between customers and banks.


Losing fees
But the impact of XS2A is that banks will start to lose out on fees from card-based transactions, which has already come under pressure from the Interchange Fee regulation"

Losing fees
But the impact of XS2A is that banks will start to lose out on fees from card-based transactions, which has already come under pressure from the Interchange Fee regulation. Accenture's report notes that: “It remains to be seen how much the customer experience for PISP transactions will differ from that for existing card-based payments – but, in estimating the potential uptake of PISP services, it’s clear that the merchant will be key.”
Decision time for banks
The report also states that European banks now face a decision of whether to become a banking ‘utility’, or to continue to play a central role at the heart of their customer’s daily lives. Accenture sets out four primary strategic options for banks in order to respond effectively to the threats and opportunities of PSD2, which are represented in the graphic below.

These four options in effect represent just two different paths for banks: either accept PSD2 passively, remaining as you are (and risk losing 'customer ownership') or accept PSD2 proactively and expand the bank's payment services to offer advice, API platforms and become more integrated in client's everyday life.

E-mandates don't have to be complicated. They could work like the Ideal system in Netherlands and MyBank system payments approval in which a payment is approved, except that in this case, a mandate is approved. The problem is that only Italy and possibly a couple of other countries are keen on this solution.
And via the SMS system like the SMS Direct solution.
But they both need your approval to fly.

Citi’s Treasury and Trade Solutions group has launched electronic document submission (“eSubmit”), a digital service that allows clients to complete the account opening process by returning electronic versions of account opening documentation rather than paper, in some Western European countries.
“This is an important advancement for Citi as we continue to execute against our goal to deliver a simple, streamlined, account opening process”, comments Sabine McIntosh, Global Head of Account Services Product, Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions.  “By embracing the move toward digitization, and continuing our efforts to digitize our services, clients using eSubmit can be more efficient in managing their bank account management requirements.”
Roll-out
The new offering, to be rolled-out in phases to select Western European countries including Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, France, Jersey and the United Kingdom, aims to eliminate the paper intensive process of account opening while speeding-up the overall process of onboarding.  The service will also offer clients an accelerated method to sign documents when account signers are geographically dispersed. The service was previously made available to pilot clients in the United States and Canada.

CTMfile take: eSubmit is a useful small step, but it doesn’t overcome the tortuous and repetitive steps in KYC which requires new levels of co-operation and standardisation that banks and corporates haven’t achieved yet"
8093,3497,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/stripes-billing-product-makes-debut-in-europe,Stripe’s billing product makes debut in Europe,2019-04-26,,"US tech company Stripe, which specialises in online payment processing for internet businesses, is rolling out its billing product in Europe.
Built on top of the company’s core payments infrastructure, Stripe Billing simplifies the recurring billing process for software-as-a-service (SaaS) and subscription-based companies and is now generally available for Stripe’s European customers.
The company noted that the subscription e-commerce market has grown annually by more than 100% over the past five years and is growing even faster in Europe than in the US.
“Subscription and SaaS companies have been some of the internet’s greatest success stories up to now, but we’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible, especially here in Europe,” said Tara Seshan, product manager for Stripe Billing.
“With Stripe Billing, companies of all sizes now have access to advanced invoicing tools that will also help them comply with strong customer authentication (SCA) and VAT requirements. We’re excited to power the next generation of European subscription companies as we continue building the economic infrastructure that will grow the GDP of the internet.”
Stripe Billing uses advanced machine learning infrastructure to help businesses boost their revenue and growth, while reducing engineering efforts and also automatically generates invoices on business’ behalf.
According to the company: “Instead of manually retrying cards, Stripe Billing’s smart retries use machine learning to figure out the best time to retry failed cards. In the US, where Stripe Billing launched last year, smart retries have led to a 7% lift in recovered revenue, on average, for businesses using Billing. This is revenue that the business would not otherwise have earned.”
SCA compliance imminent
“SaaS, subscription and recurring revenue business models have become a major force for economic growth on the internet across Europe,” commented Jordan McKee, research director at 451 Research.
“However, for the vast majority of companies, running a billing and subscription system at any scale is both laborious and costly. This function will become even more complex once the SCA regulations take effect on September 14, 2019 in Europe.
“Stripe Billing aims to mitigate this complexity and expense for European companies of all sizes by smoothing the path to SCA compliance, and democratising access to enterprise-grade billing tools"

Banks therefore need to walk the tightrope of managing their risks and ensuring security, while making all this seem easy to their customers.
Robust authentication processes are the only way to fight and prevent online fraud and behavioural biometrics is being increasingly looked at as a way to deliver secure, reliable – and, importantly, 'frictionless' – authentication, with particular benefits for mobile users, according to this blog by Vasco. Vasco's Tom Dubois writes: “Up until now, banking institutions normally submitted mobile users to traditional authentication methods, which often proved ineffective. Since behavioural biometrics takes place without a users’ knowledge, the user experience improves.”
How does behavioural biometrics work?
We're already familiar with the idea that biometrics uses data about our biological, physical bodies to check that we are who we say we are. Hence we have smartphones that give us access by scanning our finger or thumb prints and we have retina or iris scanners, and machines that can recognise us by scanning and recognising the unique pattern of veins in our fingers. And then we also have facial recognition technologies and voice recognition. The list will probably keep growing.
Behavioural biometrics looks for the unique patterns in our behaviour, rather than our biological idiosyncrasies. Of course, this refers to our digital behaviours, in other words: how we interact with our mobile device. This can include how we use a website, how we type, swipe (finger pressure and swipe patterns) or use the mouse. The technology can detect the unique characteristics associated with each person's interaction with their mobile device and this becomes their 'behavioural fingerprint', which can become an authentication mechanism that the user is hardly aware of. A better way of putting this is that the bank/security provider is able to compare the user's digital behaviour (behavioural biometrics) with the user's stored profile. The bank can then give the user a risk rating or score based on the similarity of current behaviour with the stored profile's behavioural characteristics"
8096,3498,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/behavioural-biometrics-is-changing-the-fight-for-online-security,Behavioural biometrics is changing the fight for online security,2017-09-26,,"A better way of putting this is that the bank/security provider is able to compare the user's digital behaviour (behavioural biometrics) with the user's stored profile. The bank can then give the user a risk rating or score based on the similarity of current behaviour with the stored profile's behavioural characteristics. And the greater the similarity, the lower the risk that this is a fraud attempt, so the customer can gain access with fewer authentication steps.
In its white paper on behavioural biometric authentication, Vasco explains how this works: “The greater the similarity between the profile and the user’s activity, the less the bank has to worry about the user’s identity and intent. A lower degree of similarity justifies additional layers of authentication before granting the user access to the online platform.”

CTMfile take: Behavioural biometrics is a way of improving security for mobile devices and improving the customer experience at the same time. We'll probably be hearing much more on this in future"

In June 2019, the bank announced its plan to establish the e-engine in the first quarter of 2020, with support from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). The inaugural trade was executed with the bank’s counterparty, United Overseas Bank (UOB). Using the e-trading engine, Standard Chartered says it achieved a reduction in trade latency of over 80%.
The first trade, conducted from 3:15 pm on 20 January in Singapore, delivered a 40% increase in trading volume compared to the average daily volume in the same time period last week. Estimated profitability generated from the trading volume rose more than 30%.
“This is a key milestone for Standard Chartered in support of MAS’s goal to enable more efficient access to liquidity in the Singapore FX market,” said Michele Wee, head of Financial Markets Singapore at Standard Chartered Bank. “As one of the major FX participants in Singapore, we remain committed to leveraging this new solution to effectively serve our clients’ currency and commodities needs by offering them a seamless and consistent pricing experience for their hedging requirements. Our clients have a keen interest in going digital - FX e-trading volumes continue to grow year-on-year. In 2019, we have seen a 30% uplift in spot trading volumes via our e-channels. With the enhanced efficiency proven by this trade using the new e-trading and pricing engine, we expect this positive trajectory to continue.”
Standard Chartered’s e-trading engine offers its clients FX e-trading of 130 currencies and more than 5,000 currency pairs in spot, forward, swaps, non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) and options, as well as commodities e-trading for both precious and base metals.

Just under half – 45 per cent – also expect to hire more full-time employees, although many – 53 per cent – perceive a greater level of uncertainty around their future business prospects.
Economic alignment for first time in decade
Deloitte's Mark Whitmore commented: “The optimism of private companies worldwide reflects an economic alignment taking hold for the first time in years. In the face of increased uncertainty, private companies seem to be leveraging their inherent agility to gain a competitive edge.”
The report, Global perspectives for private companies: Plans, priorities, and expectations, surveyed about 1,900 executives in 30 countries. And despite a perceived greater level of uncertainty around future business prospects, only 2 per cent of respondents globally said they are not at all confident that their company will be successful over the coming two years, which could suggest that private company executives tend to be a very positive and optimistic group of people. However, it could also reflect that executives tend to look at a range of factors when gauging their own business outlook and the current environment offers a various potential change-influencers, from developing technology to shifting political scenarios (some of which could favour business, such as lower corporate tax in the US).
Interconnected and international
Two of Deloitte's experts, Robert Rosone and Roger Nanney, wrote in an article accompanying the report: “While this outlook is buoyed by growth across the world’s major economies, it’s not purely a function of the business cycle. Private companies are both increasingly interconnected and international, and less exposed to single markets for their performance. In fact, even as 53 per cent of executives told us uncertainty was increasing, they are optimistic and plowing ahead. Private companies are investing in new technologies and talent, banking on their agility as conditions change to stay ahead of their competitors.”
Investment in technology
The survey's respondents expected some significant impact on their business from technology trends including: cyber intelligence, analytics, cloud infrastructure, mobile devices and big data.

OneStream Transaction Matching is designed to allow companies to collect and match large volumes of transactions from multiple sources to quickly identify and resolve differences to accurately finalise period-end balances much sooner than with third-party tools or spreadsheets.
“Account reconciliations and the matching of transactions across multiple systems can be a very time-consuming process for large enterprises with multiple systems and thousands of accounts to reconcile,” said Tom Shea, CEO of OneStream Software. “OneStream Transaction Matching replaces spreadsheets and third-party point solutions so our customers can accelerate the matching and account reconciliation process within our unified platform. Early users are seeing significant time savings by starting transaction matching much earlier in the close process resulting in faster and more confident period-end financial reporting.”
This solution complements OneStream’s Account Reconciliations solution, both of which are available on the vendor’s XF MarketPlace of productivity and business solutions. Both are fully supported solutions that can be deployed on-premise, or in the cloud so end users can manage these processes either from the office or remotely.
OneStream Transaction Matching allows companies to match transactional-level information from multiple sources utilising a rules-driven approach that identifies and resolves differences in transaction data. This replaces spreadsheets and manual processes that prolong period-end account reconciliations and can delay the financial close. Failure to accurately match transactions and reconcile accounts can result in reporting issues or even undue write-offs that can negatively impact a company’s income statement and balance sheet.
Built on the unified OneStream XF platform, the new solution eliminates additional licence costs and maintenance of third-party tools while leveraging existing and proven data integration and data quality capabilities of the platform for loading and matching large volumes of transactions. All the reporting, dashboarding, commentary, audit trails and other capabilities of the OneStream XF platform are available for account reconciliation and transaction matching, providing visibility, control and optimisation"

The Cyber security benchmark 2017 by KPMG found that:

56 per cent of the companies surveyed pay insufficient attention to cybersecurity in their annual reports;
only a quarter of the companies dedicate at least a paragraph to cybersecurity in their annual reports; and
fewer than than 20 per cent of companies consider cyber risks a boardroom responsibility.

Hot cyber topics
The report also highlighted some of the 'hot cyber topics' for corporates, including:

Board awareness: The importance of promoting cybersecurity awareness at all levels of the company, among employees as well as among the board. “Investors, governments, and global regulators are increasingly challenging board members to actively demonstrate diligence in the area of cyber security.”
Privacy: Data privacy is an important topic that can help reassure customers and is now in the spotlight as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will come into effect from 25 May 2018.
Security monitoring: Investment in security monitoring (for example through a security information and event management – SIEM – system) is a way of demonstrating awareness and commitment to addressing cybersecurity risks.
Threat intelligence: Gathering intelligence on cybersecurity threats is also an important part of preparing for such attacks but few companies mention this in their annual report.
Vendor risk: As companies are increasingly dependent on their supply chain, vendor risk management is an important factor to consider – and to demonstrate awareness of the risk by stating actions taken in an annual report.
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are designed to support industrial processes, but they are also susceptible to malware, hacking and network disruptions. Companies that depend on or use these systems should show their awareness of this cybersecurity risk in their annual reports.

Eastern Europe lags in cybersecurity reporting
The study also highlighted the reporting practices of companies in Eastern Europe with regards to cybersecurity, showing that only 3 per cent consider it to be a board-level responsibility, while more than three-quarters failed to mention cybersecurity at all in their annual reports. Reporting on cybersecurity in Eastern European companies – and particularly in Romania – is therefore considered to be less of a priority than for companies in other regions"

Gabriel Mihai Tanase, KPMG director responsible for cyber services, said: “We know that organizations from several industries carry out cyber security projects but have not mentioned these in their annual reports. Are cyber activities not being made public for fear of a perception that the existence of cyber security related processes might create the impression that there is a security issue or does this lack of reporting simply reveal how cyber is still perceived at board level in Romania?

More intelligence required
As cybersecurity impacts every area of businesses, more and better intelligence is required. De Kneef writes ""with intelligence sharing, we can adapt much more quickly to the constantly shifting strategies of our adversaries, who have their own sharing platforms enabling them to keep up with the latest attack tactics.""
Through the SWIFT ISAC, the organisation shares intelligence across its 11,000 user community on the latest modus operandi, tools, tactics, techniques, and procedures that we have seen used in attempted payment fraud. This is designed to enable customers to immediately apply this information to their environment connected to SWIFT.
Investing in people
While automating the more technical aspects of sharing has enabled the sharing of threat intelligence even faster, De Kneef believes that the human element is still important:
""Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning will enable the technical aspects of cybersecurity to be automated, which in turn will free up more human brainpower to focus on wider cybersecurity strategy.'
Building a community
Human judgement sits at the heart of the fight against cybercrime and De Kneef calls for industry members to make an effort to build and sustain trust among their peers and play an active part in the intelligence sharing community:
""Building trust on a consistent basis can encourage more institutions to actively share, and not just consume intelligence. The more people share, the better the quality of our intelligence will be.""
Intelligence sharing is a must
Financial services is changing with the introduction of new data-driven business models, APIs, fintechs and advances in big tech. While this change is adding values to lives and businesses, it also significantly increases the attack surface, heightening cyber risks. De Kneef concludes: ""In this rapidly evolving threat landscape, intelligence sharing is a must."""

Approximately 16% of small and mid-sized companies have switched banks in the past 12 months, well above the industry’s historic average “churn rate” of 10-11%. In addition, more than one-in-five companies say their satisfaction with their banks took a hit during the pandemic, and 85% of these disaffected companies are either actively seeking a new bank or say they are open to solicitations. 
The Greenwich Associates data shows that companies believe certain banks failed to support them during the crisis. Among the top frustrations cited by company owners and executives were a lack of communication and follow-through from their banks on PPP loans and an unwillingness by banks to provide relief on outstanding loans.  
Among companies that changed banks for all or part of their business in the past year, the top reason for making the switch was disappointment with bank relationship managers for pandemic-related issues. For example, when asked to name their top considerations when hiring a new bank, companies cite loan forgiveness/flexibility on loan terms and conditions as their number-one priority. 
“The COVID-19 crisis served as a flashpoint for many commercial banking relationships,"" said Chris McDonnell, managing director at Greenwich Associates. ""For some companies, their experience was one of frustration, which contributed to a perceived lack of attention and service. Such cases have led to an increased willingness to switch banking providers.”  
Digital differentiation 
The second reason cited for changing business bank providers is 'better online banking capabilities and services'. This is a factor that did not even crack the top five bank-changing drivers until recently. 
“Almost overnight, COVID-19 turned digital banking capabilities from a nice feature to a defining factor,” said Greenwich Associates consultant Dana Schwaeber, who notes that more than nine-out-of-10 small businesses and mid-sized companies report using their banks’ website in the past 90 days, and more than 60% have emailed with their banker.
Economic sentiment turns toward the positive
After six months of pandemic-induced pessimism, business owners and executives have turned optimistic"

Economic sentiment turns toward the positive
After six months of pandemic-induced pessimism, business owners and executives have turned optimistic. Small businesses and mid-sized companies participating in a recent Greenwich Market Pulse have been predicting continued economic contraction since March. In September, the Greenwich Optimism Index moved into positive territory, meaning that for the first time since the outbreak of COVID-19, a majority of respondents expect economic growth, as opposed to deterioration, in the six months ahead. 
How do banks survive?
Last week, the white paper, 'Banking After COVID-19: A Look at the Current and Future State of Banking Revenues, Clients and Business Models', from Coalition Greenwich, a CRISIL company, laid out the long-term scenario for banks to remain relevant in corporate and transaction banking.
The white paper noted the issue with relationship managers that the latest data has highlighted, namely that banks will need a complete revamp of coverage and engagement models that includes rethinking the relationship manager role, re-skilling their bankers, and retooling their processes in a way that harnesses technology and data to create real value for clients.
Some tough decisions will also have to be made. The white paper stated that banks will have to hit the reset button on business practices created for a 'normal' interest rate environment. A case in point is cash management, where banks will have to reintroduce fee-based models to preserve profitability. There will be pushback from corporates, but over the long term, there is likely to be an equilibrium in the spirit of 'co-opetition' to preserve the economics of the industry"
8115,3512,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/five-ways-for-releasing-trapped-cash-in-china,Five ways for releasing trapped cash in China,2012-12-18,,"At the recent Cash Management University in Paris, BNP Paribas explained how there are now five ways to release trapped cash in China:

Dividend payment: this is the traditional way of cash repatriation. However, it is subject to withholding tax, and has a limit of frequency about once or twice a year.
Inter-company loan: This is subject to SAFE's (State Administration of Foreign Exchange) approval. Domestic companies can lend its excess cash to overseas group/sister companies. The loan principle is not subject to withholding tax, but it is capped at the unpaid dividend of the domestic entity and the maximum tenor is two years.
Panda Solution (Back-to-back solution): Domestic entity to keep the excess cash with the bank in China, and use it as collateral to issue a SBLC (Stand By Letter of Credit guarantee) to overseas, where the overseas bank will extend a credit facility backed by this SBLC. (If the SBLC is in foreign currency, an overseas guarantee quota given by SAFE would be applied on the SBLC issuing bank. If the SBLC is in CNY, then PBOC's (Peoples Bank of China) clearance is necessary.)
QDII (Qualified domestic institutional investor): The QDII is a special channel approved by the government to the domestic financial institution like BNPP. Under the QDII quota, the bank can help domestic companies to invest its excess cash into overseas capital market instruments, including the Corporate Bond issued by its own group. (Basically there is no limit in terms of the tenor and amount -only limit is the QDII quota assigned to the bank.)
Cross-border cash pooling: According to the recent deregulation by SAFE and PBOC. MNC groups are allowed to establish "" cross-border cash pooling "" structure to link it's domestic cash pool with overseas cash pools. In this practice, an overseas lending quota needs to be approved by SAFE (FCY - foreign currency) or by PBOC (CNY). (BNP Paribas stressed that this still under piloting stage, any corporate intending to establish such structure needs to find a partner bank, and prepare a joint proposal/application to seek the authority approval.)

No longer is it a matter of which bank will take my cash and cheques, process my card payments, and deal with the the automated clearing house payments. Now there are many new and different systems and options in almost every country. It is becoming a major problem for corporates world-wide. 
Increasingly multi-national corporations are using the omni-channel payment system providers to be sure they can optimise making and collecting payments. Adyen - the world’s biggest who say they provide “The only payment solution you’ll ever need” - is used by some of the biggest and most international names in the business, e.g UBER, Spotifiy, NETFLIX, etc. But how do you choose which payment provider to use? Adyen’s white paper entitled, “Choosing a new payment partner” reveals a lot about Adyen, but also about the key issues in coping with the exploding number of payment options. No company cannot afford to be ‘cut-off’ from key new markets.
Payment provider partners
As you would expext Adyen stress the need for a partner(s) in collecting and making payments. They recommend companies should look for partners who:

take a collaborative approach to business
have a laser focus on the end user experience
understand what a customer’s needs really are.

How to evaluate
Adyen believe that overall new partners need to be evaluated in terms of their: cultural fit, seamless technology and expertise/credibility. Stressing key aspects in each area they sugges that corporates should look for:

Cultural fit: “It simply means that the most successful customer-to-client relationships happen when the two companies work together synergistically and passionately. With a strong cultural fit, the two companies energize each other. Without that fit, they drain each other through countless hours of relationship and project management. It’s not easy to find, but cultural fit should be of foremost importance when evaluating your options"

Now, two years after Wirecard’s collapse and admission that half its supposed revenues did not exist, FT has come forward with more claims about how the German payment processor pulled off its scam. According to this most recent report, Wirecard fabricated client data and other internal records in order to gain a €900 million SoftBank investment in 2019. The bank expressed concerns about going forward with the investment in the face of FT’s allegations against Wirecard and asked to see certain client lists to prove that the payment processor’s operations were legitimate. Wirecard reportedly showed them falsified data in response. The resulting substantial investment seems to have suggested a “vote of confidence” amidst FT’s questioning, and it was followed by another €500 million in bond issuance. These new details and others – such as Stephan von Erffa, Wirecard’s former head of accounting, admitting to document forgery (again, per FT) – are continuing to come out as Markus Braun, former Wirecard CEO, and other executives are prosecuted in Munich"

8123,3516,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/tink-banks-poor-quality-apis-threaten-success-of-psd2,Tink: Banks’ poor-quality APIs threaten success of PSD2,2019-07-04,,"With the regulatory technical standards (RTS) deadline of Europe’s new Payment Services Directive (PSD2) fast-approaching on September 14, European banks have failed to provide the proper technology environment for third party providers (TPPs) to access payments data as required by the new law, claim Swedish open banking platform Tink.
European banks were mandated to make their production application programming interfaces (APIs) available by June 14 - three months before the final RTS deadline. Tink’s analysis shows that while 69% of the production APIs were available by that date, not a single API was found to be of sufficient quality to have met the required regulatory standards for integration.
Tink reports that banks are welcoming feedback on the quality of their APIs and show willingness to improve. However, the lack of the expected seamless transition from the sandbox environment from pre-June 14 “risks derailing the vision of PSD2 – and compromising the experience of millions of consumers who rely on innovative money management services that they have come to enjoy in a pre-PSD2 era.
“In order to ensure a continued service to end users from September – and in the absence of quality production APIs – TPPs will now need to rely on contingency methods (fallback) stipulated by PSD2.”
However, Tink believes there is a risk that banks could be “let off the hook” from providing these contingency methods – and provided an exemption simply on the basis of having made their APIs available, regardless of the quality. This would see TPPs forced to operate in a poor-quality working environment.
More time needed
Commenting on his company’s findings, Tomas Prochazka, vice president of product at Tink, said: “With less than three months to go until every financial institution in Europe is required to be fully compliant with PSD2’s RTS, this is concerning news.
“While efforts from both sides are being made to make the deadline work, TPPs all over Europe are being left in the dark. Unanswered questions - such as who will be granted an exemption from providing a fallback method and when these exemptions will be issued - mean they are faced with a suboptimal working environment.
“It’s in everyone’s interest to make sure that end users are able to continue enjoying the services they have become accustomed to after September 14 – and to ensure PSD2 and the open banking movement are successful"
8124,3516,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/tink-banks-poor-quality-apis-threaten-success-of-psd2,Tink: Banks’ poor-quality APIs threaten success of PSD2,2019-07-04,,"Unanswered questions - such as who will be granted an exemption from providing a fallback method and when these exemptions will be issued - mean they are faced with a suboptimal working environment.
“It’s in everyone’s interest to make sure that end users are able to continue enjoying the services they have become accustomed to after September 14 – and to ensure PSD2 and the open banking movement are successful.
“Therefore Tink is calling for an extended transition period during which TPPs will be allowed to access financial data through the PSD2-required contingency methods, while giving the banks sufficient time to produce APIs that meet the required standard.
“We’re seeing a positive response from banks wanting to get their production APIs up to standard, and we will work together to make this happen. But as an industry, we must recognise reality and accept that unless we put in place contingency plans, the fantastic opportunity presented by open banking is in peril.”
Tink says that its analysis is based on attempts to integrate 84 APIs representing 2,500 banks across 12 of Europe’s main markets in Europe. Collectively, these banks cover 90% of the population in each market surveyed.

debit cards and credit transfers were the leading digital instruments in 2015, while check usage continued to decline globally
despite the increased adoption of digital payments, cash continues to be in the mainstream, especially low value transactions.

Non-cash markets 
Future growth and trends in non-cash markets:

initiatives to promote cashless societies, technological innovation, and financial inclusion merges the key drivers of the significant growth rates of non-cash transactions in the emerging markets
financial inclusion measures in emerging Asia will fuel high-growth rates of non-cash transactions, particularly in India, Vietnam and Indonesia, as mobile and other forms of digital payments are deployed
in mature markets, a combination of NFC/contactless technology and mobile payments may lead to the development of new ways of making and collecting payments
based on their model and hypotheses, the report estimates that global non-cash transactions will increase at CAGR rate of 10.9% from 2015-2020, with developing markets, 19.6%. 


CTMfile take: In the developing markets, corporate treasury departments need to plan for a massive increase in the use of non-cash payment systems plus innovative new ways of making and collecting payments.

Originally part of a project of the Association Française des Trésoriers d’Entreprise (AFTE) – French Association of Corporate Treasurers – to disrupt various aspects of treasury, Cashforce got involved to explore how AI could improve the cash forecasting process. For the initial proof of concept, the company worked closely with a large, globally operating corporate to make this a reality using their financial data.
“While our platform is already globally recognised for providing accurate cash forecasts, we keep on exploring how we can further improve our view on the future,” commented Nicolas Christiaen, CEO Cashforce.
“By including AI into the mix, we will provide both the CFO, finance and treasury departments with even more accurate, efficient and best-in-class cash flow analytics and cash forecasting solutions along with a single version of the truth.”
As an example, Cashforce’s ‘buffer-algorithm’ will back-test its current cash flow forecasting model and re-apply these results onto the current model. In addition to the application of smart logic such as customer and vendor payment behaviour, this will result in much more accurate forecasts. “Companies will be better able to predict the cash outcomes and avoid surprises,” the group promises.
“By including a feedback loop into the forecast algorithm, Cashforce is able to accurately predict customer payment behaviour, unexpected invoices, growth, seasonality and the like,” says Mark O’Toole, head of Cashforce for the Americas.
Next generation
After this first release, Cashforce reports that it is already working on a next version of the AI-driven forecast, by looking at more complex patterns. Several methodologies are currently being explored, ranging from basic methods such as time-series to more complex concepts such as deep-learning and neural networks.

“By leveraging innovation, we continue our strategic journey to drive digitisation throughout our worldwide operations,”  said John Ahearn, global head of trade for Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS). “We process nine million transactions annually, and the NextGen project will help us optimize our processes from the back office to the front, by expanding the use of digitisation, automation and advanced analytics.”
“This real-time solution will help us to be able to more efficiently detect transactions with potential compliance concerns up front,” added Valeria Sica, global head of trade services for Citi’s TTS.
“This solution assists in managing and comparing a large number of data points across current and prior transactions, which will provide more context and usable data to aid the decision maker in reviewing global trade transactions, which has traditionally been a very manual process across the industry.”
Focus on compliance
Citi reports that the Global Trade business continues to digitise its platforms and processes using the latest innovation. As a part of this strategy, Citi digitises millions of trade-related pages annually with optical character recognition (OCR). NextGen will continue this legacy by utilising AI technology to automate manual processes.

In early April 2020, AFP conducted the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic survey. The survey revealed that cash is organisations’ top priority in this crisis, and practitioners are taking somewhat drastic measures to preserve it. A majority of companies (69%) have delayed hiring new employees, and many of them (61%) are instituting a total hiring freeze.
Taking a long-term view, treasury departments are building liquidity buffers in case economic conditions worsen or recover slowly. Fully 70% of organisations have either delayed planned capital expenditures (41%) or are in the process of delaying them (29%).
The increased focus on potential future impacts of the pandemic on organizations’ liquidity has led to a high-profile role for treasury. Seventy-eight percent of respondents said their organisations are including representatives from treasury in meetings and discussions surrounding the pandemic. In addition to preserving cash, treasury has increased its emphasis on cash forecasting and expanded the time horizon for forecasts. A total of 88% of respondents are now making this a priority.
Protecting cash also means making sure companies do not lose money to unauthorised transactions. Seventy-four percent of organisations have either implemented or plan to implement strict compliance procedures to protect against fraud.
“Determining the amount of cash required to sustain the business is vital to weathering a crisis of this magnitude,” said Jim Kaitz, president and CEO of AFP. “Treasurers are guardians of corporate liquidity, and this pandemic is requiring them to go the extra mile to ensure the sustainability of their organisations.”
“These results mirror what we’re hearing from our clients, that cash forecasting, adoption of digital payments, and renewed fraud mitigation processes are critical for preparedness,” said Sharon Haward-Laird, head, North American Treasury & Payment Solutions at BMO. “Thankfully, a wide variety of industries and organisations are taking the necessary steps, working with their customers, suppliers and partners, including their banks, to navigate what’s ahead.”

The improvement reversed a similar-sized loss in June, which punctuated a 13% drop in the first six months of 2022 for supposedly safe investment-grade bonds. Predictably the summer season means that there are only a handful of new corporate bonds being sold, but there are signs that activity will accelerate as the second half of the year progresses, in contrast to the record 33 days of zero issuance so far this year. Rising interest rates coupled with a sustained widening of credit spreads of corporate bonds over government benchmarks have produced difficult market conditions for all companies outside of the highly liquid well-known names. Even these must be attractively priced to succeed, as the premium that issuers have to offer over existing debt increased substantially from the boom period of 2020 and 2021. The prolonged era of negative yields that even some highly rated companies enjoyed is now over and the landscape for fixed income is very different, with the European Central Bank (ECB) ending sub-zero rates and winding down its quantitative easing (QE). Several deals last week show that household names with an attractive credit spread are being enthusiastically received by investors despite the summer lull. Sweden’s Volvo sold €500 million of five-year notes (see next story below) while French multinational Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA brought a three-part €1.5 billion deal, including a sustainability-linked 10-year. Scottish energy company SSE PLC sold a €650 million-euro seven-year green deal that saw an order book nine times the issued security. Green-linked bonds accounted for 23% of total issuance this year, down from 27% in 2021, but conditions are not comparable. The Covid-19 pandemic heavily impacted primary debt markets when it hit in March 2020, with the resulting massive fiscal and monetary stimulus creating a surge in debt raising, with commensurate investor demand to match. So there is currently much less pressure for funding, but the vacuum is temporary, and while underlying yields and credit spreads are certainly more elevated than at the start of 2022, the new normal has to start somewhere. A fairer comparison, it’would be to assess this year’s total with 2019 and earlier"

A fairer comparison, it’would be to assess this year’s total with 2019 and earlier. Corporate treasurers must factor in two elements when deciding whether to borrow in the bond market. First, underlying market interest rates: The benchmark German 10-year bund yield started this year at minus 11 basis points but soared to 1.77%. With yields now around 1%, it is considerably less scary to test where new funding levels might reasonably be. The second element is the yield premium that riskier companies have to offer above governments, which has also subsided. The iTraxx five-year euro investment grade credit default swap index, which was less than 50 basis points in early January, peaked at 127 basis points in mid-July, but has fallen back close to 90 basis points, meaning that the cost of raising funds for mainstream companies has typically reduced by over 100 basis points in the past month. However, as we head towards winter Europe’s energy crisis is expected to intensify, and there are also potentially market-moving Italian parliamentary elections due on 25 September. Additionally, the ECB’s second-quarter bank lending survey showed loan credit standards tightened considerably for consumers, especially on residential mortgages. Access for wholesale bank funding also deteriorated which will be a key concern for the ECB should it deteriorate further. September will provide an important test of investor appetite, particularly whether the freezing of QE has been fully priced in. The ECB, which sits on €344 billion of investment grade corporate debt, reinvests maturing bonds into the market at the rate of over €2 billion monthly and about a quarter of that has been invested into primary deals. Nonetheless, the overall buying impact is significantly diminished, as the ECB is no longer adding about €5 billion monthly of new purchases. However, investors should welcome the absence of the biggest buyer crowding out much of the available liquidity float in European investment grade. Analysts believes that provided market volatility remains subdued, the second half of 2022 should be substantially more active for corporate debt supply. While borrowing costs are highly unlikely to once more become as cheap as in 2021, the recent market calming has made yields bearable for companies, while sufficiently attractive for investors to once more test the water"

The group surprised the market last week by issuing a five-year note that drew orders for six times the deal size Volvo Treasury AB, the manufacturer’s financing arm and one of Sweden’s biggest corporate-bond issuers, attracted more than €3 billion (US$3 billion) of bids for a €500 million note- a coverage ratio of six times, according to an inside source. The demand allowed Volvo to slash the spread offered to buyers at a time when sales of corporate debt in Europe are plunging and markets are recovering from the steep bond selloffs since the start of 2022. The bonds will price at a spread of 53 basis points above midswaps, well below its opening target of about 85 basis points. The revised pricing is about nine basis points above Volvo Treasury’s outstanding debt curve, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal provides a test of a market where European businesses have been hesitant to borrow, as rising interest rates from central banks worldwide and resurgent inflation fuel concerns about a steep drop in economic growth. That resulted in one of the slowest markets for new bond issues in Europe in years, with sales by nonfinancial corporations down about 40% from 2021. Bloomberg reports that the Volvo sale is the first from a European firm outside the finance industry since 2 August and comes after a global rally pushed a gauge of corporate default risk to the lowest in more than two months. Volvo Treasury’s sale is the borrower’s third foray into Europe’s publicly syndicated debt market this year. A 2025 maturity euro note priced by Volvo Treasury in May has tightened about 20 basis points since it was issued"

We are ensuring that optical fibre reaches every village until the last mile.The dream of Digital India be attained through rural India,” he said, listing his government’s plans for the programme. Launched in 2015, the Digital India initiative aims to expand India’s digital economy through inclusion and empowerment. The Ministry of Electronics & IT has set up common services centres (CSCs) to deliver citizen-centric services. Modi said it had also created over 400,000 local entrepreneurs. While almost 60% of India's rural population have yet to start actively using the internet, the overall number of active Internet users across the country is expected to rise by 45% over the next three years, reaching 900 million by 2025 As of June 2022, a total of 531,203 CSCs were operational across the country, of which 420,198 CSCs were operational at ‘gram-panchayat’ or village level and equipped with broadband connections under the BharatNet scheme to deliver last-mile connectivity. However, according to recent media reports CSCs had stopped operating and maintaining BharatNet’s fibre optic cables and equipment in June, due to the company’s overdue payments According to a recent report by IAMAI-Kantar, internet usage is growing in villages but understanding the technology remains a challenge. While stressing the growth of start-ups and the innovation ecosystem, Modi said the people behind these companies come from smaller cities and villages and that India is an “aspirational society” where changes were being powered by a collective spirit. The prime minister also praised India’s world leadership in real-time digital payments, where it accounts for nearly 40% of all transactions, helped by the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and India’s fintech sector"

The European Commission is pushing ahead with new legislative proposals designed to accelerate the post-Brexit shift of derivatives clearing – especially euro-denominated interest rate swaps – from the UK into EU central counterparties (CCPs) such as Eurex. But Klaus Löber, chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) says the policy risks backfiring as euro swaps trading may simply move away from CCPs that face the toughest EU scrutiny. After Brexit, the EU said it would not allow EU market participants to clear euro derivatives in London after June 2025, citing a need to end its heavy reliance on that market in the same way the bloc is cutting dependency on Russian energy. Brussels is reported to be working on a law for later this year with “incentives” to move euro clearing from the London Stock Exchange (LSE), which dominates euro clearing, to Eurex Clearing in Frankfurt, using a likely mix of mandatory and voluntary measures. However, Eurex’s chief executive Erik Mueller has also stressed that relocating euro clearing from London to the EU must be “market-led” rather than mandatory, and believes the shift is already well underway. Speaking at the IDX derivatives industry conference in June, Mueller, Chief Executive of said market participants want competition and Eurex now accounts for €27 trillion euros (US$27.4 trillion) in euro swaps contracts, a 20% market share. “The trend is clear,” Mueller told conference delegates, adding that the “pie” will grow to swell volumes further.“We will keep pushing for a market-led solution that would be the best outcome for everyone.”"

Yet in the context of foreign exchange, the points of contact with ESG are still very much evolving. In a newly published white paper, ESG in FX: The current state of play, ING’s team of Chris Turner, Antoine Bouvet and Jaems Wilson consider, where ESG has found a footing in FX, where it can grow, and the roles to be played by both the public and private sectors “Financial market derivative products linked to ESG continue to evolve and as in other asset classes, those in the FX space typically involve two counterparties agreeing on ESG key performance indicators (KPIs),” the team notes. “Should the client meet those KPIs (usually assessed annually by an independent third party such as an auditor) then the client would either secure a cheaper hedging cost on, for example, a strip of FX forwards or in some cases a cash rebate depending on the amount of FX hedging business done in a year – the latter effectively a loyalty scheme contingent on ESG goals being met. “A further scheme being looked at by some participants is the integration of ESG metrics into FX counter-party considerations. Those metrics could generate reductions for fee-linked products (e.g. FX algorithms) or indeed affect the pricing of a counterparty’s access to FX liquidity. This could see banks offering FX pricing incentives to clients with better ESG ratings and equally clients allocating business to banks based on the banks’ own ESG ratings. “Constraints to the further growth in some of these initiatives could be the lack of homogeneity in the KPI metrics, where each client requires their own specific ESG targets. Greater take-up in these products could require some move towards standardisation of ESG benchmarks, although the regulation of benchmarks in derivatives remains a minefield. “Another challenge in the FX space is that the industry works on fine margins, meaning that the scope for rebates and the financial incentives to meet ESG targets may not be as large as in some other asset classes or products. The paper concludes that several touch points exist between ESG and the FX industry. However, while progress has been made, a move to the next level probably requires an even greater push towards green assets in the public sector"

Expect a lot more transparency on this subject with the introduction of the European Commission’s Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR), which comes into force at the start of 2023.”"

The technology is mainly used for identification and access control, or for identifying individuals that are under surveillance.”, according to techtarget.com. Today in cash and treasury management and payment systems, biometrics is being used in security and control systems and services world-wide. Finger prints were just the start, now biometrics covers both physical and behavioural aspects in cash and treasury management.
Physical biometrics
Technologies used now include:

Scanning fingerprints, irises, faces
Scanning blood flow in a finger, e.g. Barclays Biometric Readers
Voice recognition, e.g. HSBC voice recognition security system.

And many more are being developed as technology advances.
Behavioural biometrics
Behavioural biometrics is less developed than physical biometrics, nevertheless it possibly has more potential than physical biometrics because it often uses a mult-faceted approach. However, it can be more complex to implement and manage:

Some solutions monitor how the account holder starts a conversation or asks for an order to be completed
Social biometrics are now being used to develop a person’s behioural footprint gathered through Google, Facebook and other social networks  which is much more difficult to put together than a single fingerprint. Also it requires much more work to assemble a social biometric footprint. Then there are the standards needed to get agreement that this social footprint is acceptable and this one isn’t.

Here the use of Artificial Intelligence and big data will be essential.
Multi-factor authentication 
In identifying who is really there, the view was, for many years, that three factor identification was essential. It was regarded as ‘The Ultimate Combination’, as shown in the Smart Card Alliance’s classic chart below.
Three factor digital identification

The emergence of social biometrics supported by big data analyses is showing that this classic view may no longer be applicable. Maybe, all that will be needed are two things: Hitachi’s Finger Vein Authentication Technology (or similar techology) + social biometric footprint which has many facets and could detect whether the account holder is being threatened?

The time and cost of developing sustainability frameworks are significant, and synchronising the implementation of that and raising debt continues to be challenging for a number of corporates, as per the report.

This year report focuses on four themes: liquidity management; digitalisation; cybersecurity and global tax reform. They held workshops with experts and practititioners across Europe which are summarised in the report - mainly by quotes from the corporate treasurers and experts who participated. Experts from BNP Paribas, PWC, SAP, the European Association of Corporate Treasurers provide comments in each of the sections and and are joined by different corporate treasurery practitioners, so the report is basically made of quotes from those involved. The quality and importance of the quotes varies, but overall the report is well worth perusing for some of the important pieces of advice and insight.
New dynamics in liquidity management 
Cash and liquidity management is a core activity for treasury functions globally, but the combination of regulatory and market developments, and the emergence of innovative banking and technology solutions, is challenging treasurers to rethink their cash operations and liquidity decision-making. The section covers: a negative view of cash, and the feasability of cash pooling. Comments included:

Joanna Bonnett, Group Treasurer, PageGroup, “We regularly hold a surplus cash balance and we have not experienced difficulties in placing this with our banks. However, in a negative interest rate environment, some banks have charged subsidiaries to hold surplus cash in euros. We are now migrating our European entities to a single transactional banker and expanding our zero-balancing cash pool to centralise cash and in turn avoid the effect of negative interest rates.” 

This next part covered cash centralisation, with Massimo Battistella, Manager, Administration Services, Accounts Receivable, TIM S.p.A. commenting:

“For us, the ability to centralise payments and collections into one location was one of the major value propositions of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) and embedded into the SEPA formats. It is therefore frustrating that diverse rules in Europe affect the choice of location for a payments factory, and in some cases there need to be workarounds or transitional approaches until the regulatory environment is clearer and more consistent"

“For us, the ability to centralise payments and collections into one location was one of the major value propositions of SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) and embedded into the SEPA formats. It is therefore frustrating that diverse rules in Europe affect the choice of location for a payments factory, and in some cases there need to be workarounds or transitional approaches until the regulatory environment is clearer and more consistent. For example, one option we have found is to centralise payments, but channel these payments through an account held in the name of the relevant subsidiary (i.e. payment in the name of (PINO) instead of payment on behalf of (POBO).”

After case studies on their inhouse bank (from Solvay) and the use of virtaul accounts (from Hoffman la Roche), there is a summary of virtual accounts, a discussion of the challenges, the impact of Open Banking, how to use the technology and combining this with accelerating payments, the report concluded that, “Treasurers should be starting now to consider the implications and opportunities both for their treasury and finance function and for the wider business, and identify particular operational, commercial or strategic benefits that may be derived.”
Talking tax
Here the speed of international tax changes was stressed and David Ledure, Tax Partner – Belgium, PWC, pointing out that, “Tax rules have generally been rule-based in the past, but new rules are increasingly principle-based. This is less black and white, and requires more interpretation.” While the need to adopt a combined tax and treasury approach was also stressed. The tax reform checklist is important:

Perform an internal audit of vulnerabilities in the way that treasury operates: for example, are there locations where profits are booked but that lack substance?
What structural changes need to be made to address this?
Can the locations of your treasury centres be justified? Tax authorities will ask the same questions, so you need robust answers. If the explanation is clear, document it; if not, you may need to change it.
Identify friction points in cash and treasury management processes and structures. What is causing these points of friction? What techniques exist to address them (e.g"

Identify friction points in cash and treasury management processes and structures. What is causing these points of friction? What techniques exist to address them (e.g. POBO and COBO could enable simpler banking and liquidity structures, easier bank account administration and centralised processes)? Are barriers to implementing these techniques real or perceived?

And the case study on Delphi Technologies adoption of “A new tax culture in treasury management” has important lessons for corporate treasury departments.
Digital Treasury
The report has grand statements about the role of technology in corporate treasury. The report concludes that success in digitalisation can only be achieved by:

Treasury should aim to remove complexity, improve transparency and control and free up resources to ‘do more with less’ as part of its digital agenda.
Today’s solutions can be configured to meet specific requirements of each treasury func- tion, as opposed to requiring vendor customi- sation that can be expensive to implement and maintain.
Digital technologies should not represent a new cost, but demonstrate savings or additional value.

The three case studies contain important ideas and thoughts: 

“Honeywell: The power of connected™ in treasury” and their “Streamlining KYC with Docusign”  
Dassault Systems. “Enabling best-in-class treasury through digitalisation”
Digital cash transformation at GE.

Cyber-risk and Fraud 
The report, of course, stresses that “cyber risk and fraud has emerged as treasurers top priority, cited by 82 percent of treasurers in the ACT’s Business of Treasury 20172 report.” And as expected it goes through the main threats:

Common forms of cyber-attack 
Need to share experiences

Common forms of cyber-attack 
Need to share experiences
Combatting fake vendor and CEO scams
Payment fraud in practice
Cloud v. On on premise solutions
Re-imagining system access.

But it is the case studies, as nearly always, that provide the nuggets of insight:

Total liquid assets of domestic nonfinancial companies at the end of 2012: $1.8 trillion.
Such eye-popping sums have aroused public indignation. Investors are insisting that companies stop hoarding their cash and start paying it out. Politicians are demanding that they start spending it, in order to create jobs and boost the economy.
But companies are already returning cash to shareholders in record amounts. S&P 500 firms paid $282 billion in dividends in 2012 and are on track to disburse $311 billion in 2013. Buybacks are on the rise, too, as is merger and acquisition activity.
Whether or not individual companies are hoarding cash is debatable. But studies show that among all publicly traded companies, the average ratio of cash to assets has been steadily rising for the last 30 years. Researchers have found good reasons for this rise, but hoarding by entrenched managers isn't one of them (more on this below).
Since the financial crisis, many companies have been keeping more cash on hand. ""Most of us large corporates have fundamentally changed the way we approach liquidity,"" R. Bruce McDonald, CFO of Johnson Controls, told CFO earlier this year (see ""Situation under Control,"" January/February). ""We want to have a lot more of it, a lot more comfort from a lot more secure sources.""
At some point, determining whether a company has too much cash is a subjective judgment, depending on the eye of the beholder. Recently, CFO asked four expert beholders how they see corporate cash today, and what might entice companies to start using more of it. Here's what they said.

8152,3528,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/brexit-uncertainty-spurs-demand-for-exchange-traded-funds,Brexit uncertainty spurs demand for exchange-traded funds,2019-04-04,,"Continuing uncertainty over the UK’s departure from the European Union has spurred investor demand for exchange traded funds (ETFs) to limit the impact of extreme fluctuations in the value of sterling.
Data provider Thomson Reuters Lipper reports that net inflows into Europe-based ETFs hedged to sterling reached record levels in Q1 of 2019. The funds attracted almost €1.7 billion over the three months as investors sought protection against currency risks linked to a no-deal Brexit.

The inflows were around seven times the level of a year earlier, with sterling-hedged fund attracting no more than €256 million in Q1 2018.
The largest inflows were seen in February, when nearly €1.1 billion moved into ETDs hedged to the British pound. Invesco, UBS and Lyxor were among the asset managers gathering most of the new money into sterling-hedged ETFs during the just-ended quarter.
Detlef Glow, EMEA head of research at Lipper, said that increased demand for currency-hedged funds came during a strong sales period for the ETF industry generally. “An additional driver might be Brexit, as investors fear currency losses and are therefore hedging themselves against this risk,” he commented.
Lipper’s data shows that over Q1 2019 Europe’s ETF sector attracted almost €27 billion, with February alone accounting for around half that total.
US concerns
Andrew Walsh, head of passive and ETF specialist sales for the UK and Ireland at UBS Management told Financial News: “We have seen a few of our larger clients, and many other mid-sized clients, going into GBP-hedged in recent months, on the basis that sterling is undervalued at current levels, no matter what the eventual outcome on Brexit.”
Paul Syms, head of ETF fixed income product development for EMEA at Invesco, told the magazine that the asset manager had seen particularly strong demand for the GBP-hedged version of its US treasury bond 7-10-year ETF since it launched in January.
“There are various reasons for investors buying longer-dated US Treasuries, which would include – but are not limited to – concerns about an economic downturn in the US and easing of monetary policy,” he added"

“In addition, the UK is obviously facing the numerous risks around Brexit, which may cause sterling to be more volatile than in normal market conditions. For a sterling-based investor, the potential for sterling to rise or fall quite dramatically around the decision on if, when and how Brexit takes place -which has nothing to do with their economic view – may be a reason to hedge foreign currency-denominated assets.”"

Kantox, see figure below, have proven that it works and that they can provide full liquidity in any currency.

Kantox have found that, on average, 78% of their clients are saving more than 80% compared to their banks or brokers. So for every million USD traded, clients save more than USD 15,000. (For further details, see.)
Kantox growth and vision
Kantox have grown from the two founders - Philippe Gelis and Toni Rami - to a team of of 50 people and in 2014 grew by 250%. Kantox believe they are on track to achieve the 2nd billion in just a few months time. The growth has been achieved by working with smaller clients, providing excellent service and earning their trust.
As one CFO remarked, “The idea of matching my FX requirement with another corporate’s and then just buying the balance on the wholesale market, is compelling.” Kantox’s vision: “To bring transparency, efficiency and fairness to the financial industry and to society as a whole, ultimately.” is also compelling.

CTMfile take: As Steve Jobs said, “Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in square holes. The ones who see things differently.” And here’s to the financial service disrupters, like Kantox, who want to use new, efficient and fairer solutions, “To invert the traditional finance business model by putting our clients first and profits a distant second.”"

According to reports, the latest measures will have a serious impact on the Russian economy, severely limiting Russia’s ability to import and export commodities. Additionally, the central bank restrictions target access to the U.S. $600 billion or more in reserves, blocking Russia's ability to support the ruble as it falls with tightening Western sanctions. US officials stated sanctions have already affected Russia, sending its currency to the lowest level against the dollar and giving their stock market the worst week in history. The sanctions include removing major Russian banks from the SWIFT financial messaging system, which processes billions of dollars a day at over 11,000 banks and other financial institutions globally. Details of the sanctions are still emerging as the U.S. and EU work to limit the impact of restrictions on other economies and on Europe’s purchases of energy from Russia. According to the EU Commission, disconnecting many commercial banks from SWIFT would ensure these banks are cut off from the international financial system and harm the ability to operate globally (blocking exports and imports). Sanctioning Russia through SWIFT was difficult for the EU since they trade volume with Russia amounting to 80 billion euros, approximately ten times as much as the U.S. According to the report, the U.S. embassy states that U.S. citizens in Russia need to be prepared for alternative payment methods if credit or debit cards are rejected. Additionally, the State Department advises U.S. citizens against traveling to Russia at this time"

Additionally, iwoca commented that embedded financial products can resolve issues faced by small businesses and their customers. According to the report, 80% of B2B companies depend on slow and tedious bank transfers, while the majority of the remaining 20% settle with inflexible and costly card payments. iwoca noted that SMBs are owed £10,000 on average at any given time due to the lack of swiftness of these payment methods and the unavailability of funding embedded in them. Traditionally, suppliers have had to select between either simple payments or flexible terms. According to iwoca, using their new B2B payment method that combines open banking and embedded finance through iwocaPay enables buyers to obtain a streamlined payment process and flexible payment terms, while suppliers reduce the burden of outstanding payments tied up in their invoices. Additionally, iwoca stated that funds from the suppliers’ sales would immediately appear in their account, and buyers could disperse costs over 90 days to best fit their cash flow needs. Per iwoca, one of the main benefits of the solution is that the majority of its finance and payment products are through embedded partners such as accounting software platforms, neobanks and online marketplaces, enabling companies to access services they utilize on a daily basis easily. This approach provides a simple and fast application approval process while greatly reducing declines. As traditional payment methods continue to change significantly, digital providers such as iwoca are finding ways to enable suppliers to have instant access to funds, built-in flexible payment terms without risk, and control over who pays fees for extra time"

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) established the National Payment Strategy (NPS) 2022-2025 to develop and implement policies to control the establishment, regulation and supervision of an efficient and effective payment system in Kenya. The payment systems in Kenya transformed over time, with the modernization of domestic payments, introduction of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, mobile money services, and strengthening and automating their clearing systems. According to reports, the NPS in Kenya was created to meet the diverse needs of the Kenyan people and its economy by supporting their country’s goal to become a digital, innovative and inclusive economy. The NPS was implemented in 2004 to address risks due to the lack of a real-time settlement system, primitive policy and regulations, and limited trust in payment instruments. With the new NPS, Kenya’s legal and regulatory framework should strengthen its economy. The CBK will operate with principles that include trust (in guaranteeing payments), security, usefulness, choice and innovation. Additionally, the CBK emphasized that all payments will follow these principles, instilling citizens’ trust in their monetary value supported by a secure, customer-centric system. The CBK is also exploring CBDCs as the emergence of payment innovations, such as cryptocurrencies, continue to evolve the payment landscape"
8159,3532,ctmfile.com,https://ctmfile.com/story/how-to-wipe-out-uks-190bn-corporate-pension-fund-deficit,How to wipe out UK’s £190bn corporate pension fund deficit,2020-12-07,,"New pension funding and investment strategies could eliminate the UK’s £190bn defined benefit (DB) pension deficit, analysis released by PwC shows.
According to PwC’s Pension Funding Index, volatility in markets, including equity market surges and a slight increase in government bond yields, combined to reduce the deficit to £190bn at the end of November, to its lowest level since the UK’s first lockdown. 
The Pension Funding Index shows how the UK’s 5,300 DB pension schemes are measuring their own deficits, based on their scheme-specific strategies. For the first time this month, PwC has introduced an Adjusted Funding Index which incorporates two strategic changes available for most pension funds backed by viable companies: a shift towards higher-return cashflow-generating assets instead of gilts, and a deferred approach for funding very long-term potential life expectancy improvements which have not yet happened. Using this Adjusted Funding Index eliminates the aggregate deficit, illustrating the opportunity for pension schemes to consider new approaches.
“Most pension fund trustees and sponsors have become conditioned to a world where there is always a funding deficit,"" said Raj Mody, global head of pensions at PwC. ""The Adjusted Funding Index illustrates that it doesn't have to be that way. You would hope that after years of paying in cash to pension schemes to repair deficits, then eventually that plan would have worked out. Trustees and sponsors should review their strategy and deficit assessment afresh, without being tied to historic approaches or assumptions which may now be out of date.”
Strategies to reflect reality
PwC notes that at the start of this century, funding DB pension schemes was still primarily about building up assets for future use when pensions became payable. Now, DB schemes are typically closed to new entrants and have a more mature profile, paying out around £50bn of pensions annually. That means strategies should adapt to reflect the practical realities of what DB schemes are now required to do.
While this approach may not be appropriate for distressed schemes, those with viable sponsors who intend to run off their schemes over time, instead of transferring them to insurers or consolidators, can focus on generating cash flows for paying pensions as they fall due. In particular, this can include a diversified portfolio of assets whose income matches the pension obligations, including investments such as UK infrastructure"

While this approach may not be appropriate for distressed schemes, those with viable sponsors who intend to run off their schemes over time, instead of transferring them to insurers or consolidators, can focus on generating cash flows for paying pensions as they fall due. In particular, this can include a diversified portfolio of assets whose income matches the pension obligations, including investments such as UK infrastructure. Many pension schemes already operate like this to some extent and there are opportunities to optimise the approach and extend it across the industry. Crucially, this part of the asset portfolio does not need to rely so heavily on UK government gilts and comparable bonds, as is currently the case and as many pension funds are assuming to move into when it comes to calculating their deficits.
“The £190bn deficit represents money that companies are planning to pay into their DB pension schemes over the next decade or so,"" commented Emma Morton, pensions actuary at PwC. ""In a lot of cases this money won’t be needed - or, at least, it isn’t needed yet. In the current economic environment, trustees and sponsors could be asking themselves whether there are more efficient ways of running pension schemes. This would allow spare company cash to be directed elsewhere, such as topping up pension accounts for defined contribution (DC) members who typically have lower pension values than defined benefit members.""
Hard target
PwC also observes that, across the universe of DB schemes, there have been several cases where scheme deficits have been removed, but then the target has been reset even higher, forcing the sponsor to continue with additional cash contributions. Sometimes there are good reasons for this, for example if the sponsor is not viable in the long term or if the intention is to buy-out the benefits with an insurance company. But in other cases, this approach does not make sense. It could lead trustees to make the wrong decisions about the risk in their investment portfolio, and could cause unnecessary anxiety for members into thinking that the pension scheme does not have sufficient reserves"

By introducing this service, BELLIN says it is proactively responding to the increased security requirements put forward by SWIFT in 2020, and is making specialists and the necessary technology available. BELLIN SWIFT Service clients will be able to make use of this service free-of-charge, which the firm says will enable them to complete the audit in no more than half a workday.
“It makes complete sense that there is more and more emphasis on security in treasury,” commented Phoebe Schmalz-Ziekow, product manager Solution Management at BELLIN. “However, the effort involved in meeting these requirements needs to remain manageable. This is why we have worked out solutions with SWIFT that create maximum security for this powerful network at minimum effort for its users.”
The company says that it is this pragmatic attitude and the long-term collaboration that have made BELLIN/SWIFT solutions successful. This was highlighted at BELLIN’s annual 1TC Treasury Convention last week, when BELLIN and SWIFT celebrated 200 BELLIN SWIFT Service clients. In 2013, BELLIN was the first TMS provider to enable corporates access to the SWIFT network through their own BIC. This was followed by the first fully-integrated digital matching solution in 2014 and the first TMS-integrated gpi payment solution as part of the SWIFT g4C initiative in 2019"

Now available to issuers across the Apac region, the card-led product will “address the demand for flexible financing options among underserved businesses and help to rekindle growth among the region’s countless smaller operators during a period of continued economic uncertainty.” Across region, enthusiasm for commercial BNPL products is reported to be strong among small businesses. Interest is especially high in India and Singapore where 77% and 80% of respondents respectively expressed interest in using an instalment product specifically created for small businesses, according to a recent Mastercard-commissioned survey. Taking a global view, 75% of SME business owners who have used instalments for personal purchases said that they would be likely to adopt similar payment solutions for their business. “Drawing on this consumer familiarity with BNPL offerings, Mastercard’s new commercial product has been tailored for the unique needs of small businesses, enabling cardholders to convert any purchase from 80 million merchants worldwide where Mastercard is accepted into monthly or periodic instalments,” said the group. “With Pay & Split, businesses can easily make instalment finance purchases from suppliers around the globe and better manage cash flow, while eliminating the hassle of managing fragmented payment plans.” Pay & Split also aims to address a second critical pain point for SMEs. During the pandemic, accessing credit or finding loans with favourable lending conditions has been a challenge for many small businesses — especially those lacking the financial record that more established businesses typically have. In addition to providing simpler access to financing, the new card will offer a path for these smaller operators to build a credit history"

It also opens the door for businesses to generate a credit rating, which can then be used to apply for more sophisticated credit products as the business grows.” Mastercard adds that the card can be easily implemented by financial institutions by leveraging their existing card issuing infrastructure or by speaking to their Mastercard account manager about the Mastercard Instalments Payment Service.
